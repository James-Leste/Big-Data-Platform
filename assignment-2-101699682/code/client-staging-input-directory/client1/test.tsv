Giving today is not the same as giving yesterday. Now, everyone knows (better than the giver) exactly what they want. The Amazon card gives them the privilege of selection, shopping online for home deliver, and the option to redirect the funds as they see fit! I now give gift cards through Amazon to anyone who shops on Amazon and does not object to this kind of gift.	2015-08-31

If you’re going to be spending $10 or more for a gift card, and have more than one person to give a gift card to, I would recommend you purchase this set of three to your recipients. On the other hand, if you are going to be spending $50 or more on an individual gift card, you may want to consider the gift box option.	2015-08-31

So I know for a fact that it's simple, convenient, and super fast, within 5 minutes or less I receive an email with the redeemable gift card amount. I now have a giftcard balance of almost $20.00 which is enough to buy something nice or if I want I can put it towards a pricier item then Amazon will deduct the giftcard amount and then I can use whatever other payment method I choose on the remaining balance.	2015-08-29

You redeem them to your account. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />This makes it so you can buy that one expensive item you normally could not afford on any one of your cards.<br /><br />DOWNSIDE:<br /><br />While the first 2 or 3 of these will be fairly instant (within 5 minutes) you will run into a wall if you try to buy to many at once. After about 3 in a short period of time Amazon will be forced to manually authorize each of these with their respective banks.<br /><br />This can take 3-4 hours.<br /><br />Please ...

These giftcards are great for multiple reasons:<br /><br />You want to get something expensive, but don't have the money on any one card.<br />You want to send someone an instant gift card to their email to shop with<br />You simply don't like the physical variation<br /><br />For people who don't have high limits on any cards, or have enough money in their checking account this is an especially convenient choice.<br /><br />As Amazon doesn't allow you to pay with multiple cards, you would instead use your respective cards to buy yourself one of these gift cars. You redeem them to your account. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />This makes it so you can buy that one expensive item you normally could not afford on any one of your cards.<br /><br />DOWNSIDE:<br /><br />While the first 2 or 3 of these will be fairly instant (within 5 minutes) you will run into a wall if you try to buy to many at once. After about 3 in a short period of time Amazon will be forced to manually authorize each of these with their respective banks.<br /><br />This can take 3-4 hours.<br /><br />Please ...

Needed a quick gift due to a last minute invitation, and this was clearly the best solution. Sure, I could give cash or check, but I knew the birthday boy wanted a few things from Amazon that were well over the typical gifting amount.

The old days, people spend so much time and $ picking out a card, and write some good words on the card. There must be some people who wished that they could erase and made changes to words on the card. After that, the card looked like scrap and got tossed. Another card was purchased and the process started all over again. When completed, actual gift (a check, cash) was then placed in the envelope to be delivered to that special someone. $5-10 was spent on top of the gift. I am avoiding all that hassle by sending Amazon gift card.	2015-08-27

No one wants to put multiple single items on their credit or debit cards. So I by a gift card for myself and then redeem and buy all my kindle items that way. I would love to be able to skip the step of having to email it to myself and then redeem it. Why don't you guys offer an instant gift card for your kindle accounts. By and redeem at the same time. That would be perfect! Otherwise its a great way to buy kindle items.	2015-08-27

Since most people use Amazon for something, and you can use the gift cards on almost everything, they are useful for a lot of people. It's extremely easy to buy a gift card. You get a few different ways to deliver your gift including printing a physical card and emailing it to the recipient. The reason I only gave them 4 stars is that when emailing a gift card you can specify the date you would like it to be delivered, but you cannot specify the time on that day. This made me have to print the gift card instead of emailing it because I didn't want it delivered too early. Printing the gift card was extremely easy and makes a decent looking card. Overall these are a great gift choice.	2015-08-27

I received an email confirmation from Amazon regarding the bonus coupon immediately after the cards were shipped out. The cards themselves were easy to use - just enter in the code printed on the back into your Amazon account and that's it.<br /><br />I am sure it's pretty standard nowadays, but still I think it's worth mentioning that these cards never expires and do not have hidden &#34;service&#34; fees that eat away at your balance after a certain period.	2015-08-27

Amazon has something for everyone, which makes it a good solution for the people who have everything or for the people whose tastes are different from my own. For instance, I don't know what books or music to buy for my grandson. It's best that he be able to chose for himself. I like being able to buy the card online and to print it on my printer and not having to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Using the gift card is easy for the recipient as well. Everyone I know has access to a computer. Also there is no surcharge for using the card. In contrast, I received a Visa gift card last year. To use it I had to go to a retail store because it had to be activated at a register -- I couldn't use it online. In addition, it had a $4.95 activation fee.	2015-08-26

What could be better than Amazon gift cards?  Just as a heads up for gift-giving, this particular set of gift cards arrive in a small plastic envelope with a large inventory sticker on the reverse, then inside a plain bubble mailer.  So you may want to ship them to yourself first, if you are giving them to someone else, so you can wrap them up to present them a little more nicely (if you like to wrap things up nicely).	2015-08-23

You cannot subdivide a $100 gift card into (2) $50 gift cards or (5) $20 gift cards.<br /><br />One huge advantage over a traditional mailed gift card is that the recipient does not have to be home during the day to receive it.<br />Tip:  Don't buy more than five at once because if the transaction doesn't complete they can't retrieve and resend it, you have to re-enter all five messages from scratch!	2015-08-23

Purchased these with a bonus promotion code on top, and I cannot complain. I had intended to buy some for Christmas gifts anyway, but the promo made me jump in August! The cards are awesome quality and look really good. They arrived the next day in an Amazon envelope containing each card. Inside the envelope was the card and an envelope for gifting. I highly recommend this for anyone you can't find that perfect gift for.	2015-08-22

I love the idea of being able to send a gift card at any time and having the recipient get it within 5 minutes. I just purchased one for my Nephew and it literally only took about 2 minutes for him to receive it. This was a life saver for me as I don't like close to my Nephew and I wanted him to get this on his Birthday! I especially like how can you personalize this and include a message with it - I choose a Birthday Card that had audio in it. You can't go wrong with these!	2015-08-18

I've been printing out Amazon gift cards on my printer, for birthday presents, and other events, but I really like these better. They give the feeling like you at least went to the grocery store to get the birthday present. They come in a very small envelope, and mine arrived the very next day after I ordered them. It really is next-day shipping like Amazon says it is. They come in a lot of different designs, and I liked the reading under the tree design the best.<br /><br />And, I like that I didn't have to wait in line for them to activate, like I do when I buy gift cards in the grocery store. I also like how if I get mad at all of my friends, I can just put their balance on my Amazon account.	2015-08-16

No one wants to put multiple single items on their credit or debit cards. So I by a gift card for myself and then redeem and buy all my kindle items that way. I would love to be able to skip the step of having to email it to myself and then redeem it. Why don't you guys offer an instant gift card for your kindle accounts. By and redeem at the same time. That would be perfect! Otherwise its a great way to buy kindle items.	2015-08-13

All codes worked just fine without issue. My only complaint is the fact that I didn't have the option to get them digitally. Not only would it have saved Amazon some shipping costs, but then I could just copy/paste the codes instead of having to hand type such long strings of characters. At the very least, it'd be cool if they update them with a barcode that you can scan with the Amazon mobile app for faster entry.	2015-08-13

I love the design of the plaid gift card box, it really dresses up the gift card and makes it seem a little more personal. The quality is outstanding, and it even comes with a small note card. I like writing in the card myself to make the gift special or to suggest a use for it (something I wanted to get but didn't know color, size, etc.) Perfect Holiday Gift year after year!	2015-08-10

These $15 gift cards came with $15 loaded onto them. While I would have preferred more, I only paid $15 each so I can't complain. In a perfect world, they each would have had $1,000,000,000 on them. Then I would have purchased Amazon and instituted a sixth star for reviews that only I could use. Then I would have to purchase Turbotax from Amazon (I mean, I own the company, I'd probably just have my secretary bring it to me) so I could figure out all my tax issues from receiving $2,999,999,955 in income. My basis was $45 so don't try to round up to $3B, IRS. I guess that would equal a lot of tax liability so perhaps I'm glad they just had $15 on them. Yeah, my life is much better without all the hassles of that money. Mo' Money, Mo' Problems.	2015-08-10

This is absolutely convenient and useful if you would like to prank someone on christmas. Last christmas for my best friend's gift. She wanted a $50 gift card to amazon, and if you really want to make her work for a $50 gift card you can purchase 100, $0.50 cents gift electronic gift cards and print it all out and give it to her. Pure joy, it's more than just a gift card. What's great about amazon is they let you punch in as many giftcards as you what at check out. This way, she really has to want that item to think about the effort she's putting in to punch every code. Love it, thanks for making the minimum at least .50!	2015-08-10

Amazon gift cards are an almost-ideal way to remember birthdays, anniversaries, etc.  Not only are they convenient, but they allow the recipient to select an item for themselves from literally thousands of possibilities!  I especially appreciate the opportunity to essentially give money to family and friends but not in a form (cash) that ends up in their wallet and often just gets frittered away in dribbles and dabs instead of going toward a &#34;thing&#34; that actually qualifies as a gift.	2015-08-10

Since most people use Amazon for something, and you can use the gift cards on almost everything, they are useful for a lot of people. It's extremely easy to buy a gift card. You get a few different ways to deliver your gift including printing a physical card and emailing it to the recipient. The reason I only gave them 4 stars is that when emailing a gift card you can specify the date you would like it to be delivered, but you cannot specify the time on that day. This made me have to print the gift card instead of emailing it because I didn't want it delivered too early. Printing the gift card was extremely easy and makes a decent looking card. Overall these are a great gift choice.	2015-08-10

No one wants to put multiple single items on their credit or debit cards. So I by a gift card for myself and then redeem and buy all my kindle items that way. I would love to be able to skip the step of having to email it to myself and then redeem it. Why don't you guys offer an instant gift card for your kindle accounts. By and redeem at the same time. That would be perfect! Otherwise its a great way to buy kindle items.	2015-08-09

Worthless customer support	I've had Webroot for a few years. It expired and I decided to purchase a renewal on Amazon. I went through hell trying to uninstall the expired version in order to install the new.  I called Webroot and had their representative remote into my computer at his request. He was clueless as a bad joke and consumed 29 minutes and 57 seconds of my time forever.  He initially told me it wasn't compatible with Windows 10, but I finally managed to convince him that it is indeed compatible with Windows 10 as it was working on my computer before it expired and also I showed him a review on Amazon to convince him that it works on Windows 10. Finally, he offered to connect me with a senior consultant for over 100 dollars. I declined and told him I'd fix the issue myself. This guy was less helpful than a severed limb.  After spending some time on Google, the issue is now fixed. Webroot should just get rid of their customer service and pay Google for indexing much more helpful info that their dedicated customer service can offer.  As far as the software itself. I think it scans fast, does not slow down my computer and I hope (like most other people including experts) that it's very effective in removing and preventing malware.  Years ago I did extensive research and found it to be among the best, but that was over 4 years ago. Things are fluid in the malware kingdom.  To those experiencing the same issue installing as I did - My advice - don't bother uninstalling the old version, rather launch webroot and click on  &#34;my account&#34; on the right side, then copy and past your product key in the area that says &#34;enter a new keycode&#34;, then click on Activate. This will save numerous painful hours of trying to get the thing to work.	2015-08-31

Overall I still find it useful.  One reservation is that this system (and some others) have evolved to where you just put in numbers and proceed blindly along until the end, and you are supposed to trust that everything is being done correctly, even though it is all out of sight.  Numbers flow into some forms that you never see at the time of entry until you are told you are done and you print out the final data (or save as a pdf).  Since I only do this once a year, I prefer a bit more information/reassurance along the way that all is being done correctly and appropriately.  It did save me a few dollars somewhere - I'm still not sure where.	2015-08-31

If you have never used Quicken before, I would rate this a 5 star; if you are an experienced user doing an upgrade, I would rate this a 3 as there really is not any new functionality or, if there is, I can't see it for the tasks I perform with Quicken.<br /><br />I made a backup of my existing file, and proceeded to install. Installation went without a hitch, and I didn't even need the backup as this installation recognized my file and took over from there with the conversion process: the conversion took some time to complete, so if you are doing an upgrade go find something to do around the house vs. sitting there staring at your computer.<br /><br />For the new user, this is one heck of a bookkeeping package. I highly recommend setting up the interface with your banks, investment accounts, etc. and have it automatically download to your software.

I remember back in the Windows 95 through Millenium days when programs JUST - DIDN'T - WORK well all of the time.  In those days, as many of you recall, programs were prone to glitch, freeze, crash, and become corrupted.  It's wasn't the norm, but it was regular enough that you really had to be adept at troubleshooting and reinstalling programs.  These days, though, we rarely have a computer program crash let alone become corrupted.  After all, this is 2015 and those kinds of problems are a decade or more behind us, right?<br /><br />WRONG... if you're a QuickBooks user.	2015-08-30

Tried to make a template I could save and later populate with monthly submissions so as to not remake 100% of newsletter every month. Saved copy of template vanished into computer, when I finally found it the program didn't recognize it and wouldn't open it. E-mailed for support on another subject and got a decent response after a few days on that subject. Remade templates multiple times, only to find that only one page had been saved out of three, etc. I finally went back and purchased another copy of MS Publisher to try and get the newsletter done. In less than an hour I had my template and saved it. It opens and has no issues. I pull it up to cut and paste submissions into it without problem. It works almost intuitively at this point. PagePlus just seemed to make EVERYTHING an issue somehow. They have lots of on-line videos to explain things....but what is the use if the work you save vanishes and can' be pulled up or opened after you close it? Is it me? I don't know, Adobe products and MS products don't seem to give me this problem.	2015-08-30

DO NOT buy this plan from amazon as there is some serious technical issue in the communication channel between Amazon and Adobe.<br /><br />I tried to subscribe it twice with an existing adobe ID on which I was running the trial plan and it did not work. I then created a new adobe ID through amazon and I was able to subscribe successfully. However, after a month and half, amazon abruptly cancelled the plan without my consent. Keep in mind that this plan offers Lightroom mobile - a killer feature that lets you sync low res version of photos to a sharable cloud. Canceling your plan at the wrong time may risk loosing all those photos.<br /><br />I subscribed to this plan during the prime day sale with a $40 amazon credit that was still due. I was able to get that credit (and another $10 inconvenience credit) after haggling with customer care execs, however, I do not want to renew the subscription through amazon. I went and subscribed to it through adobe. That is what I recommend everyone to do until amazon sorts this issue out.<br /><br />As far as the product is concerned, its pretty stellar. You get the latest version of Lightroom and Photoshop. I use Lightroom for all my post processing needs and it works great with RAW files.	2015-08-30

I like this product but it was extremely frustrating to purchase this product.  I was trying to get the student product because I am enrolled in college but Amazon would not let me get it at the student price without some kind of proof that I am a student.  Also, the site they provided was not very user friendly when I tried going through the process of uploading my student ID.  I spent about ten dollars more than I would have had to other wise.  Though I like this product it was extremely difficult to download.  I had a different product on my computer and it was required to conduct an uninstall before installing the new product.  The problem is every time it began the uninstall it froze my computer.  It took about two days to figure it out.  After constantly fighting with the software and hard rebooting I decided to try doing it in safe mode with internet.  This was a working ingredient that solved it all.  It would be nice if Norton actually gave this a warning or problem solver before installation.  The uninstall program was so frustrating that I was not able to get online at to receive help.	2015-08-30

Even though I activated it immediately I'm now getting a message that after about 18 months I needed to activate it again, Since this was supposed to be a lifetime edition which was purchased 1/7/2014, this doesn't make any sense.<br />I finally decided to &#34;reactive&#34; and received notice that the product key was not valid, nor was it suitable for a 64 bit system. I even double checked my Office account that product key is correct and the fact that I was operating Windows 8.1, (also a 64 bit system) at the time I installed it has me perplexed. I suspected that since I upgraded Windows 10 several weeks ago that could be the problem, but it didn't occur until today, so I'm not sure that's the reason. At some point I'll probably be locked out and need to purchase another copy, probably from another source and a possibly a different version, preferably with a real installation disc that doesn't take 3 hours to install multiple times.	2015-08-30

I had forgotten that I had tried this several years ago and had the exact same problems. Windows Explorer would not work when it was running therefore you can not open your browsers without disabling the software. (I honestly wonder if it is not actually Russian spyware - and I am not kidding)!  It is an absolute bear to get it out of the registry and it has all kinds of stubborn hidden attributes.  I spent half the morning getting it loaded and then the other half of the day getting it off of my computer.

Something that this post don't say is, that the cloud storage is installed by McAfee Central (To install McAfee Personal Locker in a PC) and the only way to download if you need it in your PC, is by Windows Store with an online user, if you have Windows 8 or 8.1 forget to install, because an error occurs, if you have a Windows local user don't work too, I always use an local user to restrict Microsoft to send information about my computer and deactivate all options in the Private &aacute;rea, in this case Microsoft request information if you use Windows 8, 8.1 or 10. After that McAfee works decently, the firewall is very good, the True Key (only works with Internet Explorer or Chrome, not Firefox, [and I only use Firefox :( ], then two apps that I can't use [McAfee Personal Locker wasting 1Gb storage space and True Key with Firefox to storage my passwords]), the antivirus runs great, detects any issue and give me a customized way to control my PC. I contacted the support team to try fix the error when I tried to install McAfee Central with Windows 8.1 Pro, but without success, first I detect what happen and I could install the McAfee Central without any help. Then finally I take the decision, if I want backup my files then I need to finish my RAID 1 solution in my workstation, because I tried with Norton with Backup too, but they removed some necessary options like the firewall with a tiny firewall that can't protect you at 100%.	2015-08-29

While I usually use the software at home, my many, many cookbooks sync through the Cook'n cloud with my iPad and iPhone if I want to browse my recipes when I'm away from my computer. To get familiar with the various features of the software, download the user manual or watch the video tutorials on the DVO web site. If you have a problem or a suggestion, contact them.

Although Amazon is not the friendliest implementation or the most helpful support, their bleeding edge approach to trying new things is awesome... I just wish they devoted more time to improving the neat tools they created so competitors would not pass them by.  Making great capabilities available to its Amazon community is also a terrific business step, but some of those products lose their compelling story as competitors bypass their capabilities.  That is certainly the case with Amazon's Cloud Drive and Cloud Drive Desktop.<br /><br />On the plus side:<br />1.  The product makes use of Amazon's incredible infrastructure to deliver massive capabilities especially as far as the volume of data stored.<br />2.  That same infrastructure provides security, reliability and scalability that may not be surpassed except by other equally large companies like Google (ie Google Drive).<br />3.  With a Prime membership, you can store unlimited photographs, and 5GB of other files.  That is more than my Google Drive which limits me to 20GB total.<br /><br />On the bad side:<br />1.  The software is buggy.  For example, until this week many users could not download and install the Desktop product without getting an error something like &#34;Something went wrong and its not your fault.  Try again in a few minutes.&#34;  Really?  I am a technical guy and I did not know what to do with this.<br />2.  The apparent capabilities are lagging far behind the competition.  For example, the Desktop will allow you to load all of your directories to Cloud Drive; however, it does not allow you to specify the destination folder.  Again, this is an example of poor architectural planning for the products being offered.  Amazon's work around was to load all of the directories and then to select them and move them to the correct folder structure.  Really?  Is that an appropriate solution?  What if you are managing a huge number of images like a photographer or a studio?<br />3.  There is little effort made on significantly improving the product once it is released.  I encourage you to Google Amazon Cloud Drive reviews and see for yourself that these same problems were reported...  years ago!<br /><br />I love Amazon's innovation.  At one time I thought it was the most innovative company on the planet -- surpassing Google.  However, it seems to be moving so fast that it forgets to keep the quality of products up-to-speed.  It is just as important to continue improving innovations to keep ahead of competition as it is to find the next cool thing.<br /><br />Anyway, I hope this review was helpful and I welcome comments.  With warmest regards, I remain<br /><br />Very truly yours,<br />JDD	2015-08-29

I had Norton 360 on it.  I uninstalled (fully) and then installed the new Norton Security.  After installation a Norton 360 Premier icon shows up on the desktop (doesn’t do anything).  When I try to scan a directory it fails, and tries to autofix.  This also fails with an error 8504, 101.  This leads to a web site that runs through options for using Norton power eraser, Norton removal, Norton recovery.  None work.  Also my finger print reader (USB) built into my HP envy system no longer works.  Yes this is a result of uninstalling Norton 360 because I also have a newer HP envy exhibiting the exact same things are my main system. As soon as Norton 360 was uninstalled, the USB finger printer reader on that system failed to work also. Both systems have windows 10 on it.  Since 360 expires in a couple days I’ve been trying to installed the new Norton without any success.  I’ve used Norton forever barring a few years when it really caused performs issues and haven’t had this kind of problem with the product ever (some problems but nothing that requires this much time). I’ll try to update later if I have any success or move to another security suite. Update:  Third system fails to work with norton security.   1st System - uninstalled norton 360 and tried to install norton security 2nd System - uninstalled norton 360 and ran norton power eraser and norton removal first then installede norton security 3rd System - install norton security without uninstalling norton 360 first.  In all cases I have a product that doesn't work and all exhibit the signs above where it gives the failure code and requests me to uninstall, run utilities and then try to reinstall (which doesn't work). All systems were upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate or Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.	2015-08-29

The truly terrible issue I had with this program was getting it downloaded from Microsoft's website. I have wasted at least 12 hours of my life trying to get this version installed. I have downloaded the program over 30 times on 3 different computers and with 3 different browsers. I have received checksum errors every time I clicked on the downloaded file. This is a known issue: https://www.google.com/#q=checksum+error+when+downloading+Microsoft+Office+for+Mac+2011. I was unaware of this when I purchased this version from Amazon. Also when I initially searched for Office for Mac on Amazon the option to get the program on disc was not displaying. This would have been my preferred option for a number of reasons, my present problems included. At least with no Internet connection I could have still installed the program.<br /><br />Finally last night I was able to resolve my issue. One of the tech support persons in the Philippines told me that Microsoft had issues with downloads via my ISP Mediacom. I actually thought of a solution that worked which I suggested to him. I had to leave the call after telling this person about my solution but was able to implement it later that evening. I had my son who lives in another city with a different ISP download the file into his or my Public Dropbox I forget which. I then dragged the disk image file onto my desktop and was able to install the program. It is worth noting that when he download the file it was the correct size hence no checksum error. The program installed without issue. I was also able to update the program through the update feature and the update downloaded using my ISP without issue. So I really don't know where the fault lies with respect to this issue. It is not as simple as it seems.<br /><br />One warning. The program included an icon for Outlook. I was curious because it was not listed as coming with the Home and Student edition. When I clicked on it and it asked for a product key. This appears to be an attempt to get you to purchase Outlook. Based on other posts I stayed away from the offer to connect to Office 365 and Microsoft Document Connection. I seemed to remember other reviewers having issues with these features.<br /><br />I am admittedly an Apple fan but I was very favorable impressed with the quick look I took of Excel and Word. They are much more feature rich than Numbers and Pages the Apple equivalents. They also have a much `busier' interface and the icons in the menu bars did not have elegance that one associates with Apple design sensibilities.ith the Home and Student edition.

Don't Get The Paid Version	First let me start off by saying that I downloaded this Antivirus and though, &#34;WOW! This looks amazing!&#34;, and then realized how ethically terrible AVAST is. I had the free version of the antivirus for 0-1 day before upgrading to a paid version. I buy and download Avast's, &#34;Grimefighter&#34;. I noticed that Grimefighter doesn't seem to be doing it's job so I call and am told my computer has been, &#34;compromised&#34;, that data from my computer would and could be, &#34;stolen&#34;. The person I spoke to, named Jose, begins to instill fear into me claiming that it was some form of, &#34;spyware&#34;, and it was a, &#34;corruption&#34;, of my, &#34;registry&#34;. I, like an idiot, fell for it. In the back of my mind, the logic began to swirl and reach it's way to my mouth, &#34;How is it possible for me to have 'spyware' and corruption of my 'registry' when I just finished building my PC last night??&#34; He then stuttered and stated that, &#34;AVAST offers a great 24/7 technical service that would have a technician ready to fix any issues you may encounter for a year called, &#34;Avast Total Support&#34;. The service costs like $179 and a one time fix would cost $119. I think you can see where this is going and what kind of company Avast truly is. The technician goes on and says, &#34;I'm here to help and I'm going to delete the viruses&#34;. I state, &#34;I have no viruses my computer was just built and turned on last night. It's an issue with my registry, malware&#34;. He states, &#34;It's all the same thing, viruses, malware, spyware and the issues stemming from your registry are because of the viruses&#34;. After about 4hrs of him manipulating my computer from his, he tells me, &#34;You're all set.&#34;. I was not at all, &#34;set&#34;! After about two days of back and forth's I lose it and demand a refund for fraudulent promises and lies. I receive my refund and invest my money in Kaspersky. I haven't had any issues as of yet. My experiences with Avast were terrible because they use these fear instilling tactics in order to con us out of our hard earned money; for a useless product. They lied about my computer having viruses and a corrupted registry, they lied saying the technician will fix everything, they sell faulty software (Grime fighter does NOT work as intended).	2015-08-29

The website keeps kicking me back asking me for my correct email address and pass word.  I'm trying to create an account here.  It's ignoring the &#34;create account&#34; button and acting like I'm just trying to log into an existing account.  I purchased the download version and it looks like Amazon doesn't provide a way to get a refund.  Very frustrating.  Should have purchased this at Costco.  No problems with returns there. Update: Called Norton support (800-844-3362).  Got connected to what was an obvious off-shore boiler room. The tech informed me that I could get charged for the troubleshooting diagnosis depending on the problem.  After several attempts to get the tech to comprehend the problem, I ended the call. The download version is on a deal-of-the-day sale ($27.99) today.  Don't waste your time. Update 2: Several hours later, I was able to register as a new customer and then downloaded the software without issue. There is an annoying pop-up you will inherit if you accept the recommended load configuration. I leveraged the Control Panel to find and get rid of it.  As mentioned, support was a nightmare (see below) so I didn't call them again.  However, I feel compelled to upgrade the product  to 3 stars.  It is working, Norton did respond to this posting, and and the price was right.  The issue I was having with the website registration process may have been due to an overwhelming response to the sale.  I suspect the Norton support staff was equally overwhelmed. Update3: To be fair, it now looks like I was not talking to Norton Support.  After they fixed their website, I was able to create an account and get the correct Norton Support phone number.   Perhaps if I ordered the key card version a support phone number would have been on it.  I went back and checked all emails & links received from Both Amazon & Norton.  Nowhere can I find a support phone number.  This is kind of a catch 22 if you order the downloaded version as I did.  It puts you in search mode which opens traps like the won I walked into.  Fortunately,  I ended the conversation and did not turn over control of my computer.	2015-08-28

Each time, though I haven't activated the preinstalled subscription, as the time approached, and for a l-o-n-g time afterward I'd get emails from Norton reminding me to renew, even when I went to their web site and requested they stop.

A bit over a week ago I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. A couple of days ago MS Word stopped working, with a &#34;repair&#34; notice on attempted use. It has been impossible to log into MS Word since. Other features of Office appear unaffected. This problem was noted by others previously, but none of the reported fixes (and I have looked at a half dozen online, including trying to fix a presumed compatibility issue) worked. So I had the word processor for a year. It is hard for me to accept paying nearly $100 per year for the word processing function. I have currently gone to a freely accessible processor, and there is no immediate sign that Microsoft can actually repair my access problem. Since MS Word was the main reason I bought the program, this is quite a disappointment. In addition, numerous attempts to uninstall and reinstall have all ended with the same unsuccessful result.	2015-08-28

Intuit is the worst company right now.  I saw on forums that a lot of people are experiencing the same problems.    I  cancelled my order within one month, well within their refund period.  I then contacted them about the refund.  They assured me, I would receive one.  Then, I waited, and waited, and waited.  I finally called them again, and sat on phone for an hour again.  And, was assured again that after sending an email with specific items, that I would get a refund.  Then, I waited, and waited, and waited.  Months go by, and still nothing.  So, I called again, sat on the phone with them for another hour or so, and got told this time that I needed to mail in certain items with a specific reference number and order details and was assured again that I would get a refund.  So, I waited, and Waited, and waited.  Finally, I get a letter from them.  Thinking, wow, that nightmare is over and I get my $220 back after wasting 3+ hours of my time (worth more than the damn refund), and what is in the letter ??  I form letter stating that I contacted them after 60-days and they would not send a refund.  Next stop, legal action.  All over $200.  Stupid, but sometimes principles matter.    What at JOKE!!!

And while there appears to be a process to correct your number of shares, it will not update your account after you make those corrections.  They just sit there in a &#34;placeholder&#34; entry, enticing you to spend even more time trying to figure out how to get the place holder to actually adjust your balances.<br /><br />You work with it over and over, thinking if you just figure out something it will all fall in place and make sense, but no.  It doesn't.  It doesn't work.  And then you go on line and search and find that everyone else has the same problems and they are not fixing them - there are no solutions.<br /><br />Finally - the Quicken is being spun off from intuit because intuit has no solutions for the problems and doesn't want to be associated with this steaming pile of bovine excrement because it is becoming an embarrassment to the brand.<br /><br />If you buy this stinking piece of crap after this warning, i pity you.

I have been using this program for years. I have subscribed to the pro version for the last 2 years.<br />Advanced System is now ASC 8 not 7.<br />Advanced System Care Pro (or the free version) is a stand alone program. But there are also downloadable (free) add ons that are useful to excellent. These add ons are downloadable through ASC.<br />Some observations I will share.<br />(1) Considering the entire program and all the bits and pieces its a great program with some serious reservations.<br />Its a great program for the everyday computer user to clean up the computer in one step/operation.<br />It does do a great job cleaning up system files. Never had an issue causing system problems from using it.<br />But my reservations:<br />(1) It seems that iObit is always trying to add programs. Programs like their Malware fighter, which I find next to worthless as compared to Malwarebytes. You have to be careful as these programs will slip on to the computer. Now these programs are NOT bad per say and can be very helpful. Driver Booster is an example of an outstanding add on  program  to update all your drivers. I highly recommend this program.<br />(2)  But the issue I have is that some of these programs  want to run in the background. There is no real need for this. It will just slow down the computer, especially if you are doing intensive demands on it. The faster the processer/ more Ram  the less of a problem this is.<br />You will need to turn these programs off under settings on each of them, You have to uncheck &#34;load at system start up&#34; so they do not boot up initially. You will also have to turn them off after use. Especially if you do not reboot your computer daily.<br /><br />I would have no problem with awarding 5 stars if these 2 issues were addressed by iObit.<br />(1) Do not run on start up is the default settings. The user can turn on if they choose.<br />  Actually Norton 360 and Malwarebytes are the only programs that I run in the background.<br />(2) Stop the add on programs without full disclosure, such as a pop up, asking the customer if they want to add this program to their computer.<br />  Saying downloading is not enough.  They can always be deleted thru  add/ remove programs or programs and features (windows 10).<br /> These programs running in the background, especially all the add on programs can slow your computer down.<br /><br />That said I do like ASC 8 a lot. But It does take some persistence to stay on top of these two issues. A novice might have problems with these items.  If you land up with all these add ons running in the background it could slow things down.	2015-08-28

I had been using Quicken since 1991.  Any long time Quicken users know that using that program is like being in an abusive relationship.  You are forced to upgrade every few years.  There hasn't been any real functional improvement in  a decade or so.  Instead, each upgrade would bring problems, as the program would bloat and bloat.  The records you have carefully maintained would suddenly develop years worth of errors.  A few years ago, I switched to Mac, and since Intuit has some sort of vendetta against Mac, and never developed an equivalent Mac version, I had to buy Parallels ($), buy Window's 7 ($) and then put Quicken on the virtual machine just to run the d**n program.  This means every time Mac upgrades their OS, you have to worry about Parallels not working or Windows not working ..... what a PIA. Finally when Quicken, through a known glitch, prevented me from connecting a few accounts online, and I was going to have to delete the accounts, and start over, I'd had enough.  Of course there was never an easy way to get any support through this. But I had so many years invested in that program I was extremely reluctant to leave.  Nevertheless,  It was time to take the money out from under the mattress and escape to the safe house of iBank.<br /><br />Since I've only been using it for a month, and I have so much data and so many accounts to review I won't say this is a final verdict.  But in general the import from Quicken went extremely extremely well.  Even though I have many different accounts:  bank, savings, loan, investments, 401K, option, brokerage accounts etc.  they all seem to have come over well.<br /><br />I've had some issues with their &#34;Direct Access&#34; duplication entries.  I also don't like that Direct Access doesn't allow bill payments to originate in iBank.  But &#34;Direct Download&#34;  seems towork just fine.  I'd recommend using only that for getting your accounts online.<br /><br />But the BEST part, is that as I've had problems, I was able to quickly get someone in a chat window who in each case, actually knew what they were talking about, and quickly helped me work out solutions.  HOW GREAT IS THAT!  I know it will take a long time to get everything just so, but knowing I really have help is wonderful, and rare enough these days.<br /><br />I agree that reporting is not nearly as good as Quicken, and I like my reports.  But I think the reports are reasonably good.  If that's the worst of it, I'll be happy.	2015-08-28

I found it to be very people friendly and is formatted in a way that a person such as me, that is not very computer literate can navigate. I have continued to purchase the new upgrades and have found that Dan Oaks and his company are constantly keeping up with modern technology. I have been able to save and print a Family Cookbook using my favorite recipes that I have collected over the years. I do not have a smart phone but with Cook'n ``, I have the program on my Kindle and comes with me wherever I go. I also own Master Cook, and Big Oven but Cook'n beats them all, not only in what the program can do, but the excellent CUSTOMER SERVICE. Of course, my first CD's customer service was made by phone and spoke to a live person, but I can understand with the volume of software sold, that is now impossible. However, whenever I have a problem, I find that customer service responds in a reasonable period of time.<br /><br />Why no voting buttons?

Quickbooks has to be the least user friendly piece of software I've ever seen. And it takes forever to load! Before purchasing it, I'd read another review that said you open the program then go make a pot of coffee. Hopefully, by the time you've returned, it's finally started up. Totally true. I wish I'd listened to that review!<br />Quickbooks is not intuitive. The layout, wording, buttons, NOTHING makes sense unless maybe you're an accountant or an old person who still uses floppy discs and a computer with green words on a black screen.<br />Bottom line, if you're under 30 years of age and like your smartphone, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! You will be banging your head against the wall trying to figure it out. Go with Freshbooks. I took our bookkeeping from a ziploc bag stuffed with 8 months of receipts to a fully completed expense report in TWO DAYS with Freshbooks (and half of the work was done on my iPhone).<br />Please, learn from my mistake, don't waste your money on Quickbooks.	2015-08-27

I like that the software comes with plenty of its own titles, transitions, particles, etc. and that users can find more of these features online for free. I also like that it's easy to create or customize and share these features with other users via the free member's website. While it may not be the easiest to use software right out of the box, it has the most professional and customizable features of the video editing software I've tried for a very reasonable price.<br /><br />One thing to note. Cyberlink could do a better job of evaluating the computer requirements needed to run the software. If you only have the basic requirements listed, the software probably is not going to run well and it might not run at all if you are processing HD video. You will need something very fast with a very high end video card if you want to process 4K video. There are many complaints about the software freezing. This happened to me often when first bought PowerDirector (I think it was version 9 or 10). I had better than the system requirements listed an a brand new computer. I went and bought a faster computer with an upgraded video card and never had the issue again.	2015-08-27

I only rated this with 2 stars because I'm giving it the benefit of doubt that it might work better for someone more technically adept than I.  I didn't find it easy to navigate the program screen, too much in-your-face notices online, not connecting to websites & finally, just not easy to find answers.  I didn't find it very user friendly; after a frustrating evening and booting up to a safe-mode screen this morning, I just couldn't really be sure i was actually being protected from anything...and that's what you're buying, peace of mind: a lesson learned the hard way.	2015-08-27

I prefer to buy digital download version.  No issues or surprises with install or use or filing.<br /><br />Here's a nice handy feature that comes with the program. (I think you have to save your tax return as a PDF once for this to activate). I like the built in PDF995 feature that allows me to &#34;print&#34; PDF files from ANY software I have on my computer.  What happens is that after installing taxcut, a new printer called PDF995 appears on your list of printers in EVERY program. So when you want to make a PDF in any program, don't pick &#34;Save&#34; but instead choose &#34;Print&#34; and select PDF995 and it will ask you where you want to save your PDF document.  Taxcut does not have to be running, just installed.for this feature to work. I use the PDF995 every day to save web pages and other things on my computer as PDF files.	2015-08-27

Once long a go Qucken was the software to use for personal and business finances.  Sadly those days are gone.  I have used quicken since 2001 and 2015 will be the last version I will purchase.  I have watched this once great software slide so far  the last few years, with 2015 being the worse.  While the software is still use able it is full of so many small bugs that make it almost useless.  Entries in the ledger are covered by Quicken's suggestions so you can't see what you are entering.  No amount of syncing and following the suggestions at quicken.com will get your moble app and the desktop balances to match.  Worse is the Intuit lack of response to the bug reports.  Check the Intuit website yourself before you buy,  There are bug reports that are months old.  So by pass this software and go elsewhere for your financial software.	2015-08-27

The licenses I bought were never applied to my account but I received confirmation emails of the purchase as well as had my credit card charged. That started the customer service debacle. After SIX hours being continually (27 times) transferred among both McAfee and Digital River to get the product fully activated, neither side claimed responsibility even though I had supporting evidence. Whenever I requested a support supervisor (4 times), they directly hung up on me with a phrase to the effect of &#34;you're wrong our system doesn't show that&#34; or &#34;it's the other company who controls that process you'll have to call them&#34;. I requested a refund of this order- but instead (debacle #2) McAfee totally wiped out my account- I lost 5 licenses in addition to the new purchase I intended to cancel. I have since spent another FOUR hours trying to recover my original licenses but it is fruitless. McAfee customer support is a complete pass-the-blame game joke. I have a BBB complaint filed against them.	2015-08-26

I have tried different ones that say they are the best, and instead left traces of spyware to where you cannot use the computer anymore. When I had heard about this antivirus program from Webroot, I was a bit skeptical to see whether or not, it actually holds up strongly to the programs that I have used in antivirus protection like Bitdefender, which honestly has been the best third-party protection software I have used in the past several years. Webroot, comes in at a close second, which works very nicely, and gets to the heart of the matter on all of your computers. My gripe about it though, is that I wish they could've done a much more faster job at getting rid of the Trojans, the way Bitdefender has worked so well. Still, it is a good protector from Spyware, and one that I suggest you buy, if you cannot seek Bitdefender.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Convience: B<br /><br />Overall: B-	2015-08-26

The E-13 suite duplicates, in part, what is already in Elements  8 (which I have used quite happily on my older laptop for a good while). The Guided and Expert options of any real use in E-13 seem largely spins on what is already offered in the Quick Option (which, again, is pretty much the same as Elements 8). The upgrades in E-13 appear largely to rest on the social media connectability and multi-image options such as albums, calendars, and the like); options for which I really have little use or interest. E-13 does, however, seem to boot up more quickly than E-8.  Also, there were 4 fatal errors in the download, leaving several functions unavailable (Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package, for example).  Thus far, then, I seem not to have gotten everything for which I paid. There are fixes indicated for the items which failed to download, but initial efforts to discover how to install them according to information provided in the error Report have gone unrewarded.  All-in-all, I would have to say I am a bit disappointed in E-13 and am glad I waited to purchase it until the 1\2-off Daily Deal. E-13 is a welcome addition to this laptop, but with what I have seen of E-13 thus far, I would have been happier had there been a download for Elements 8.  Peter O. Welte	2015-08-26

As the main cook in the household (yes, some of us guys DO actually try to keep our wives out of the kitchen lol), I have used this program over many years through the different versions.

Cook'n makes searching for recipes quick & easy, whether you are searching by ingredient, cuisine or course. You can search through the recipes you already have in the cookbooks on the program (which you can add to via purchases in the DVO store, or easily make your own), or you can search the web for recipes via the program itself. My favourite part of this method is that once you've found what you are looking for you can capture the recipe into the program, it even captures the photo. I actually have a cookbook I've made in Cook'n simply titled &#34;Web Recipes&#34; into which I capture recipes that I want to try later. If I like the recipe I move it to a chapter in &#34;Web Recipes&#34; and if I don't like it I just delete it. Nice and simple.<br />Cook'n has had some problems over the years and like any software problems and glitches raise their head at times. The wonderful thing I've found though is when they do happen, the people at DVO really stand behind their product.

It left no tracks or bits of data to cause me any other problems with my system. I am using 8.1. My computer is back like new again.  Update on this review after living with it for sometime . It did the job it was suppose to do immediately, BUT it keeps itself presented to you all the time & parks itself  up front when you open anything you want to run. One little slip of the mouse pointer will wipe out what you were trying to open. I have removed it completely now. It unloads a lot of stuff in Recycle Bin that should never have gotten there.

You can scan recipes in there, you can just go to a website and add the recipe w/o typing the whole thing. It has a feature that if you have a recipe saved in a type written format - you don't have to type the whole thing in - Amazing.  This software has so many features it is unbelievable. Also they genuinely care about customer service.  I actually had e-mailed them a couple of times with questions and it amazes me how quickly they respond. Same day or next. There are video's as well you can watch on using the software.  Out of all the software I own and have used their customer service support is the BEST I have ever had. I have a folder full of printed recipes that I am going to scan and import into cook'n. This is so worth it. Also, as they keep adding features your software is automatically updated. Phenomenal!!!	2015-08-26

Not only is the Cook'n software easy to use when installing the recipes, but I now can carry the recipes with us when we travel.  They are on my iphone, ipad, and laptop.<br />With all of the recipes on the iphone, it makes it very convenient to shop at the grocery store and purchase everything that is need for the evening meal. Even my son, who lives 600 miles away has a copy of all the recipes on his note book.  The support team at Cook'n has been great to work with.  Their response time to any problem that arose was addressed with in 24 hours of my request.

I didn't like the ribbon interface when it came out and after all these years I still find it cumbersome but at least it doesn't make my eyes hurt. Office 2013 is full of glaring white space wasting huge amounts of screen space. There is practically no contrast anywhere and it just looks like a sea of text on a drab white background. Has Microsoft lost their mind? I've seen better UI designs on beta software and open source junk from 15 years ago.	2015-08-26

I'm definitely not an early adopter of most technology, despite the fact that I work in web content creation. However, I'm pretty self-aware of my technology needs and managed to make a 2006 iMac serve my photo and video editing needs with Final Cut Express for nearly ten years with little issue.<br /><br />When I recently upgraded to a 2015 MacBook Pro, I needed a serviceable video editing software that I could use for simple cuts and HD exports. Finding myself looking for something with functionality (and price) between iMovie and Final Cut Pro X (or Adobe Premiere), I ordered the trial version of Adobe Premiere Elements 13 and quickly found it to be exactly what I needed for my simple video editing needs, at the price I was hoping.<br /><br />If you're not happy with the iMovie interface (I wasn't) and aren't willing to spend at least $300, Adobe Premiere Elements is a great option. I was impressed with how intuitive the interface was, but maybe that's because of my familiarity with my version of Final Cut, which I've heard is similar. It has just the right amount of options for what I need--picture adjustments, integration with other Adobe software, etc.--to be the perfect choice for my video editing needs.<br /><br />Let's see if this last me for the next ten years! Things are already looking good. :)	2015-08-26

Some of the features included were ones long overdue, others new and very smart, but with MS they have to find places to take two steps back. Schools make you buy this for their convenience when older versions would work just fine. Just another college, money raking kick back scheme to help fleece students because they don't cover this with all of the tuition and innumerable fees.<br /><br />In most regards, I like my older version of office I had already bought and paid for.

Everyone beware of this Co. I wrote a lengthy review on Ripoff Reports.com.  Many complaints and problems.  Short version, after spending 2 hrs. in my computer, files were missing.  I could not always boot up; sometimes got a black screen.  In safe mode I got a message that files were missing from C drive.  I do not have a back up disk.  My computer is useless.  It is very difficult to get a refund from this Co.  They are set up this way.  Asked for refund before 30 days were up. They have a ticket system that is impossible to use.  Sent them an email from a neighbors computer stating I couldn't boot up- please call me. No call.  Finally got a refund after reporting them to the BBB and started a case through my credit card Co. Beware, they will continue charging your card after you have canceled.  These same complaints are on their own website.  There is a male on youtube complaining about the same thing.  He was also working with his Credit Card Co. I should have read reviews  before I got involved.	2015-08-26

This is the best software for screenplay composition and is very user friendly.  I remove 1 star only because there is a bizarre &#34;feature&#34; in the software.  It will automatically open to the monitor upon which it was displayed when the file was saved.  This causes a problem if you are working on a laptop and have FD open on a remote monitor when saving.  If you disconnect the laptop from the monitor and reopen FD, the FD file tries to display on a monitor that is no longer hooked up. This results in the file appearing not to open.  This is especially important to keep in mind when collaborating with others via email, as they will may not be able to see the file after opening it.  The very easy fix is to simply move the FD display to your laptop (or primary) monitor before saving.  I've never encountered composition software that tried to open on nonexistent remote monitors before.  However, the program is very good aside from that.	2015-08-26

This year I had to upgrade from 2012 which was working okay. 2012 was no dream either. Every version makes changes that add little value and rarely fix major user interface issue. Simple things like how things are sorted or how reports are displayed have the same bugs for years and years.<br /><br />The 2015 is the first version that crashes, has memory leaks, and general gets slower the longer you use it. Coming from 2012 I would expect improvements, but it is actually worse. For every previous version I stored my quicken data file on a windows share so that both myself and my wife can enter transactions/reconcile  from different computers. 2015 is so slow that I had to fundamentally change my workflow to sync files from the share locally on program launch and then sync back on program close.<br /><br />I am not even a Quicken power user. Last year I decided to ditch TurboTax for TaxACT. The only thing keeping me with Quicken 2015 are all my existing transactions and my use of Quicken Bill Pay. However, I am seriously considering moving to another program because I have really had enough of Intuit. Intuit should really be embarrassed at their software. They are like the Comcast of Financial Software.	2015-08-25

Once it is installed works well - until it doesn't. &#34;Error cannot contect to Kaspersky portal.&#34; Or it will start consuming large amounts of RAM and eventually Kaspersky just turn off by itself and will not turn back on. I've encountered failures with Kaspersky consistently once every week or two on two different computers. I've reinstalled this piece of crap so many times I've lost count. I'm sick of it.  Uninstalling it is another nightmare. It will not uninstall properly from the control panel so you have to download a special uninstaller. It takes about 1 hour to uninstall and if you try to do anything while it is uninstalling the computer freezes and crashes.  Bottom line is not matter how high the detection rate of Kaspersky it is completely worthless if it fails to run 100 percent of the time.	2015-08-25

I have been getting a tdr video failure when ever I try to run windows 10 on my PC my PC only runs for about 5 minutes I get the tdr failure and it shuts down. I look on the internet and found a lot of other people are having the same problem, I tried all the solutions people suggested including some Microsoft people and have had no luck, I am also getting an error message that I don't know what it means. My PC has 6 gigs of ram a quad core processor and a radeon video card. This is the reason I have a Mac I know they are a lot more expensive than PC's but I think it is worth it. Every windows computer I have ever had has start giving me trouble within 6 months of  purchase I have had my Mac for over a year now and still have had no problems. Either Microsoft has sent this operating system before it was ready or it is another dud of an operating system, like 8.	2015-08-25

Both these PC's are running Windows 10.<br /><br />However, I tried installing PCMatic on my son's PC which is about 6 months old.It was upgraded to Windows 10 also. However, I can't get PCMatic running on this PC. I don't have the error in front of me know but from memory, it was a DLL problem.<br /><br />I plan on installing a copy on my wife's laptop.

I didn't want to do everything online so I knew I wanted a desktop version and I didn't need all the features of Quickbooks since I'm not an accountant. So this serves me best. I'm pleased with everything—the layout, the categories, the transaction retrievals, the budgeting system...etc. I just feel that I have a much better and more comprehensive grasp of my finances. My only issue right now is that when I try to attach images of my receipts, the program crashes and has to be restarted. I would really like this to be fixed.

I use either my iPad, iPhone or laptop, as well as other forms of technology on a daily basis, for work and otherwise. Currently, I am continuing some education for my profession and needed to download Microsoft Word for the particular program that I am enrolled with. I had owned a Mac for years prior to purchasing a PC, so admittedly am not entirely used to this platform. However, how hard can it be? Just follow the directions, right?!<br /><br />WRONG!  I did as instructed and spent the $140 for the download only to discover, to my chagrin, that the program is no where to be seen on my laptop. I searched high and I searched low, then my husband did likewise later last evening, but it was not to be had. We could see that it was purchased but wasn't in the area of my computer that they said it was supposed to be.  I realize that the more computer savvy out there might be smirking at my ignorance, however, this was supposed to be a simple download, and since when does one need a Master's degree in computer science just to function on a basic level in everyday life?!<br /><br />As a result, we have my laptop at our computers tec's office now. More than likely, he will be able to figure it out quickly ( gee I hope so). The point is that it's needlessly complicated. Also, I am missing a day's work on a long assignment due to this issue.<br /><br />In addition, as if that weren't bad enough, supposedly one gets a $40 promotional gift credit for purchasing this abysmal program, for future purchases on Amazon. I had hoped that might provide some sort of recompense for the downloading nightmare. Wrong again! I just sat here for 30 minutes trying to get the code to work, and it didn't!  I wasn't able to contact Amazon about the issue either because their contact form doesn't include that as an &#34;issue&#34;. It's like this entire purchase is totally jinxed or something! I have never posted a 1 star review before. I am a fairlyoptimistic/fair person. This has just been a horrid experience.  I wish computers would go back to having the word processors already installed like in the &#34;good ol' days&#34;.<br />Very disappointed!!!	2015-08-25

It is not without issues of course, BUT their customer service is awesome!  I have had several (not many by any means) small issues with the software not opening properly, etc. and each time I have written their tech support I have received a prompt, courteous, free easy fix for my issues.  They go out of their way to make sure that you are up and running as quickly as possible.

This is big no-no for any video editor who needs to work with both audio and video.<br />- I have no intention of trying out or even touching the newer PowerDirector 13 or any other future iterations. How has Cyberlink not gotten a lot of the bugs in v12 straightened out, being their 12th version of this video-editing software program?<br />- For all my griping though, I will say that this is a sub-$100 video-editing software program, and that the price I paid was arguably fair given its capabilities (one can only expect so much from it at that price point). The bugs and frequent crashes are still extremely hard for me to overlook however, particularly since I've been doing more heavy-duty video-editing over the past year, and as a result, have just moved on to a more robust (and more expensive) video-editing program.	2015-08-24

As long as you sync your PC with a Cloud account it will ensure that I always have the most recent recipes I added to Cook'n available on all my devices. The cellphone only has to sync with the cloud the very first time, after that it syncs automatically.<br />Now that it is up and running smoothly, I simply love having my favorite recipes at hand. Getting your groceries is easier than ever (I never bring a paper shopping list with me any more - saving trees here!) I just pull up the recipe and voila, all the ingredients I need to get are right there.<br />There are several ways to enter a recipe by either capturing a recipe straight from the internet (you can copy and paste an url directly into the app's browser, or you can import it quickly with a snip-it tool. I prefer to do the latter, because I can better include a picture of a dish that way. Sometimes (depending on the format of a recipe online) the wrong picture is copied, so with snip-it I have more control over it. Of course the live recipe feed is fabulous, but I do prefer to go to some recipe sites where I find the recipes to be healthier. I do believe you can contact the support team to have your favorite sites added to your live recipes feed. Still have to contact them about that. But all in all, the app is designed to do just that, take the daily burden of &#34;what am I going to eat for dinner&#34; out of the equation, because you will receive plenty of inspiration. Or you can just pull up your favorite recipes and enjoy the process of cooking fresh daily food for you and your family. There are more ways of entering recipes, and the online tutorials are easy and simple. You will figure it out very quickly, e.g. copying and pasting from a Word Document. Anyway, I cook a lot and I use this app almost daily. When you want to cook for a crowd, you can adjust the volume of the ingredients accordling. Also kudos for the support team. They have gotten back to me every time I needed them. I gladly recommend this app to anyone who loves to cook, and is looking for more inspiration to bring great food to the table.	2015-08-24

This is what sold me on their software over 5 years ago.  The software contains some of the best features you can find in any recipe program, particularly the ability to capture recipes from almost any source.  This feature has saved me countless hours of re-typing the recipes that I find on the internet.  Also, some recipes that I find on the internet are uniquely formatted and do not import properly into any of the programs, however the use of the snip-it tool, makes &#34;cutting and pasting&#34; almost automatic.  Additionally, the customer service is very responsive, only through e-mail however.  They have responded within 2 days with answers and step by step guidance to resolve any issues (many of which were my own).  The ability to save all my recipes to the cloud gives me the freedom to plan meals on the fly with either my iPad or android device. I find this useful when I am not planning my meals, but am shopping and seeing what is on sale.  Retrieving recipes on the fly assures me that I leave the store with all the ingredients necessary.  I have recommend this program to all my friends and I recommend this program to anyone reading this review.	2015-08-24

They do not appear to reflect the current state of affairs.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I cannot recommend Amazon Cloud Drive.<br />1. The product simply isn't usable in its current state. The main issue I have is that there is no way to merge files from multiple locations. Let's say I have a Music directory with a Led Zeppelin directory in side it and in there I have the &#34;I&#34; album as MP3. I upload the whole thing to ACD. So far so good. Tomorrow I buy the &#34;II&#34; album as MP3. I can upload the Led Zeppelin directory but then it is just up there by itself. If I try to move it to my &#34;Music&#34; directory, I get the following prompt:<br />&#34;Move Name Conflict. The destination directory already has a file named: ... What do you want to do with the new file? [Skip]&#34; That's right, your only option is to skip. You cannot merge two directories together without doing it one file or directory at a time. It is absurd. Whoever designed this should be fired immediately.<br /><br />2. Amazon Cloud Drive is a separate service from Amazon Music. Sure you can download the stuff from AM and then upload it to ACD but what's the fun in that? And if you want to be able to hear your all your MP3s in AM, that is a separate subscription and you have to upload them again.<br /><br />The only way to make this work reasonably is to create a single drive that hosts your backup volume and periodically upload the whole thing to ACD. (Otherwise you'll be dealing with merge conflicts and folder micromanagement.) This does not work for me because I do not have particularly fast uploads or a drive big enough to host my entire backup locally.<br /><br />I can accept the lack of synchronization. In fact I don't actually want that feature because my archives are currently spread across multiple drives and there isn't space on any one device to synchronize a single drive. I don't want files disappearing because they don't happen to appear on one particular drive.<br /><br />**Update**<br />I gave these guys 90 days to get this fixed. They didn't. I have canceled my subscription.	2015-08-24

If you want to budget go use YNAB.<br /><br />Like nearly everybody, when I wanted to get control of my finances, I started out in Mint, and it was fantastic. I was able to get all of my accounts on there, get in the habit of categorizing my transactions, keeping track of my upcoming bills, and really start to get a handle on things.<br />After about 6 months of working in Mint, I wanted to start to get more involved in reports and budgeting and decided to upgrade to Quicken. I had used Quicken a long time ago and for many reviews, it was still seen as the standard for personal finance, plus my parents have used it for years , it's also put together by Intuit. I figured it was the natural progression and good move.<br /><br />What a mistake that was. Quicken 2015 is a cluster. It's just horrible.<br /><br />First of all, you can't migrate your Mint transaction and history straight to Quicken. This baffles me and was one of the assumptions I had made in my decision. Mint is made by Intuit, Quicken is made by Intuit, you'd think that moving from one to another would be easy. It was a horrible week long trial of downloading the files from Mint, trying to shove them through one third party converter or another. I even tried editing them by hand in an effort to get Quicken to recognize them. In the end, I was forced to just recreate all of my accounts in Quicken. All of my categories I had setup in Mint and assigned transactions to were gone. Plus I had to go back and re-categorize the transactions that Quicken had now downloaded from my banks. Even after all of that I still had 2-3 accounts that Quicken did weird things with when interacting with my banks and I had to do those manually anyway. FYI: Just because your bank interacts with Mint, doesn't mean it'll do the same with Quicken.<br /><br />It took me months to get back to the point I had with Mint, where my accounts were all generally stable, and I could get around Quicken. So I decided to try setting up a budget. First, the help section on budgeting in Quicken from the website is pathetic. It's like a single page consisting of 1. Click on this button to create a budget, 2. Name your budget, 3. Save your budget. Which makes it sound all nice and easy, but as before, it was a rabbit hole of frustration with not understanding what the hell was going on, where was it getting these numbers from, and what do these numbers even mean, anyway. I was being forced to budget for interest on my mortgage, rather than just the payment; it kept telling me that I needed to budget for my 401(k) contribution which came out of my paycheck. In the end I had no way of telling where I was at in my Frankenstein monster of a budget anyway.<br /><br />In frustration I downloaded the free trial for YNAB and OMG what a difference. In contrast to the hours and hours I had spent wrestling with Quicken I had my all of my accounts and my budget setup in YNAB within a couple of hours. When I had questions on how to set stuff up or what I should do with a particular situation, YNAB had articles, tutorials, videos, and even a free online live class that quickly answered all my questions, and got me completely setup. It is so easy, and unlike Quicken, is built from scratch to work with your budget. It's so easy to download and import my transactions into YNAB that I'm done in like 2 minutes a day. It's at the point where I'm wondering if I'm really doing everything I need to do with my finances because I'm done so fast. And I'm on a budget. For the first time in my life I'm on a budget and it feels fantastic.<br /><br />So in the end, Mint is great for what it does, but when you want to do more with budgeting, don't move to Quicken, go to YNAB.	2015-08-24

This is what sold me on their software over 5 years ago.  The software contains some of the best features you can find in any recipe program, particularly the ability to capture recipes from almost any source.  This feature has saved me countless hours of re-typing the recipes that I find on the internet.  Also, some recipes that I find on the internet are uniquely formatted and do not import properly into any of the programs, however the use of the snip-it tool, makes &#34;cutting and pasting&#34; almost automatic.  Additionally, the customer service is very responsive, only through e-mail however.  They have responded within 2 days with answers and step by step guidance to resolve any issues (many of which were my own).  The ability to save all my recipes to the cloud gives me the freedom to plan meals on the fly with either my iPad or android device. I find this useful when I am not planning my meals, but am shopping and seeing what is on sale.  Retrieving recipes on the fly assures me that I leave the store with all the ingredients necessary.  I have recommend this program to all my friends and I recommend this program to anyone reading this review.	2015-08-24

And while I immediately loved it, there was a learning curve and a few minor issues.  However, all issues were handled quickly with detailed directions and explanations.  It really is easy to pull in recipes from Pinterest and other websites.  Yes, there are a few websites that don't pull in perfectly, but then I'm not sure there will ever be a software program capable of that.  The newsletters are informative and have links to Youtube videos that are very helpful and details on updates and issues.  Then there are the weekly meal planner emails and finally the Cook'n club that I recently joined and provides an opportunity to connect with other Cook'n users.  I've worked with software engineers and I know that you can load software on three identical machines and have it behave differently on each one.  This software is exceptional because of the people behind it and their attitude towards their customers.	2015-08-23

So I wasn't having any log-in issues like the others. But I recently updated my iPhoto library to Photos, and now this app is worthless. I can't drag & drop from Photos to ACD, nor can it &#34;see&#34; my Photos.library from the finder -&#62; media section. This app is obviously not being maintained, since it isn't away of that little module that gets Photos content into the media browser. So I tried uploading through Safari. Fail. So, I have years of photos & since all iPhones repeat the same file name, uploading to safari generates a bunch of  duplicate errors with every batch i try to upload (one month of one year at a time) Since everything goes in one folder (too tedious to manually create a thousand folders). At least this could recognize these duplicate file names and add a suffix &#34;_1&#34; etc. so essentially this app and the service in general is useless right now.

There really aren't very many alternatives to Quicken anymore. I switched from Microsoft Money when that went kaput, and now I'm stuck with this. I'm not into doing everything online even though I'm an internet addict, and the options are really limited for easy to use money management software. Honestly, the only things I use this for are keeping track of my bills and as a check register. I changed my password at my bank, and now the auto update feature doesn't work anymore -- and yes, I changed my password in Quicken. I can still download directly from my bank, though. It does better at keeping track of my money than I do, which isn't really saying much. Overall it's meh, but it works. I just wish it worked better.	2015-08-23

First:  DO NOT BUY THIS SOFTWARE.<br /><br />I've had some editions of Quicken before, usually slow and clunky and hard to manipulate.  2015, once I downloaded it and linked it to my accounts, was much faster and more intuitive.  I linked all of my accounts and started to download info, set up categories, etc, and then finally was ready to export my info to excel to do some graphs and analysis.<br /><br />And...it doesn't export into Excel.<br /><br />Are you friggin KIDDING ME?!?  I have a piece of financial software that doesn't export into a spreadsheet, which every previously modern version of Quicken does as a &#34;well, duh...&#34;?  Is Intuit run by absolute morons?  Are they TRYING to destroy their brand?  And why doesn't someone, like ANYONE, else develop a decent financial software package?<br /><br />This was a joke.  I have rarely regretted a purchase as much as I regret this.  If I hadn't downloaded this digitally from amazon, I would have returned it in a heartbeat.  I'm never buying another Intuit POS product again.<br /><br />Now excuse my while I research on the Internet on how to find a kludgy workaround to compensate for a simple feature that USED to be in older versions of this same software.	2015-08-23

I had to make a exception for it. In my humble opinion, it is one of the very best security softwares out there. I really trust it a lot. It is used where I work to look for malwares. I must admit that when I saw this product on Amazon with a lifetime license, I got a little suspicious, leery. &#34;What is the catch?&#34;, I asked myself. Its developer is not issuing lifetime licenses any longer, it stopped in the first quarter of last year. If you buy it on its website, you only get a one year subscription for 25 bucks. But I took the plunge and spent the 39 bucks on it. The &#34;My Account&#34; tab on the right upper side when clicked shows duration &#34;Lifetime&#34;. I also ran mbam-check(available on Malwarebytes homepage) and it also shows no date for &#34;Expiration Date.&#34; So, I think this is the real Mccoy. Besides, I do not really think Amazon would risk its reputation by badly misrepresenting something. But in order to be 100% sure, I will have to wait until next year to see if any message pops up asking for more money to renew my license. That would be, for me, a huge disappointment, with Amazon...	2015-08-23

Really bad. This is my first Quicken product, and it will be my last. This product is by far the slowest software I've seen in awhile. I would expect this rendering speed in like Quicken 1995, not Quicken 2015. Not only is it buggy, but it is extremely complicated - and I'm a software engineer so I know my way around computers. Not impressed at all with Quicken, I will continue just making my own spreadsheets in excel.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that it could NOT get the balance of one of my accounts correct. It pulled the information from the card website, and it just kept coming up incorrect. Apart from all the odd issues, bad layout, and step learning curve, why would I pay for a product who's core functionality doesn't work?<br /><br />Will be getting a refund directly from Quicken, because Amazon has a blanket no-refund policy on software - in this case they make you go to Quicken.

After that, I got &#34;Invalid Value for Registry&#34;.  This means that (2 of many problems, just to give you examples) I could not listen to music such as .MP3 or viewed picture such as .JPG. My PC will not recognize pictures/music on my C drive or USB drive.  I am using window 10 with my new computer (got this LENOVO PC as X-mas present to myself last year from Amazon). My computer is less than a year old. I call 24/7 tech support twice. Bother times, these reps gave me &#34;not my problem attitude&#34;. They told me to pay another $179.99 for them to help fix the problem. My PC was running fine until this clean. It might be co-incident with my PC after running their products. They are NO help at all. I was very upset and regret that I bought their software. I spent all day (skipped work) fixing this problem by following instruction from window forum web site. However, nothing worked! Finally, I called my good friend who is a DBA of a big company in my town. He came over and used Wise Registry Cleaner (FREE software) on my PC. Everything is working great (back to normal). As soon as my one year end, I will buy different anti-virus software. btw, I send this company my review directly to their web site.

I reluctantly upgrade to a newer version only when support for the version I use is no longer available or as in my recent upgrade, my system crashed & I needed to reinstall - only to find that my 2013 disk was missing....so I purchased a download from Amazon, let Quicken go through it's &#34;automatic update and conversion&#34; routines, opened my previously backed up data file and found that there were conversion errors that the auto conversion routine hadn't picked up (even though it indicated they were &#34;validated&#34;).  I tried a chat window with Quicken support, communication difficulty with the operator so I contacted their call center.  A very nice gentleman with a very thick accent walked me through a &#34;manual update&#34; procedure (Amazon's download was 2015 version 4, current update is version 8!  Finally was able to get it up and running but the added 1.5 hours of time to get a product functioning IS NOT what I bargained for.  My finances are simpler now than before, I'm seriously considering migrating to a spreadsheet (Excel 2007, thank you very much) to keep my books again (full circle) especially since paper checks are a thing of the past.  I'm seriously disappointed, this used to be such a great company and product.

I would have to turn off McAfee Firewall, to get the connection back.<br />I called McAfee; 1st level, she took over my computer and removed McAfee, said the problem was my computer and transferred me to 2nd level.  2nd level gave me a choice of buying a one time fix or year policy to fix.  I told her it wasn't my computer.  She said it was; I asked her to just reinstall the McAfee they removed.  &#34;That is not possible&#34; she said...I now have Norton and everything is working fine.  I feel McAfee has adopted a &#34;dishonest&#34; policy. The McAfee employees I was talking to didn't listen at any time what I was saying, all they cared about was selling me the policy.	2015-08-22

The only reason I'm buying this is because the upgrade process from Windows 7 is so convoluted. I'm basically paying twice for a supposed &#34;free&#34; product just to save myself from countless MORE hours troubleshooting activation issues, waiting on hold with Microsoft's activation line for 4 hours with no ultimate answer or support, boot issues with Windows 7 upgrade process which is REQUIRED to supposedly take advantage of the &#34;free&#34; &#34;easy&#34; upgrade to Windows 10. I spent the entire weekend last weekend from the moment I got off work to late Sunday evening trying to get an activated product that could be disk imaged for backup. Waited it out throughout the week by downgrading to Windows 7 and tried again this weekend. I's the middle of Saturday, having stayed up late on Friday evening to make another go of it. Finally, I remit--half my hair is gone--I'll pay for the stupid full version of Windows 10 just to avoid the outright stupidity involved with having to load old software on a machine with updated USB 3.0 hardware in order to take advantage the not-so-free-considering-you-should-be-paid-for-the-time-lost-researching-the-upgrade-process &#34;upgrade&#34;. Seriously, to expect that someone waste their time installing an outdated product on likely newer hardware in order to upgrade, as opposed to simply putting in your old product key, requires some seriously flawed thinking on the part of Microsoft.	2015-08-22

I regret the 2 hours of my weekend I spent trying to make this thing work.<br /><br />First of all, to create a new file you need your Quicken web id. If you use TurboTax, you probably have one, but I do not understand why they need your web id to create a brand new file even before they know if you are going to use the online services. They force you to register the product to create a new file.  I almost turn around at that point and uninstalled the thing, but I decided to continue.<br /><br />Second, the interfase is cluttered and not intuitive. They put drop downs everywhere and it takes a while to find the action you want to perform. I left this product for a few years and I expected to be surprised with the improvements to the look and feel, but no, is the same thing I remember from before with a lot more options crammed.<br /><br />Finally the deal breaker was that I can not get past error OL-254-B.  This is hilarious. I setup one online account, worked a bit, then closed the program. The next time it opened I got this error when trying to update the online accounts. The error message tells you that you either cancelled the operation, or your data file is corrupted, or your program files are corrupted.  It looks like the guys that wrote the online services had no idea how the other parts of the application worked. I followed the troubleshooting steps, repaired, my data file but no luck. I uninstalled the program and the services worked, but the next time I logged in, the problem was back. I tried once more, because I am an optimist, but the problem came back again. I think this is related to a problem with a software update that the program tries to install. In any case, that was it for me I decided to uninstall it for good and try something else.<br /><br />From the little I saw, I think you can get most of the Quicken functionality in Mint ( unfortunately also an Intuit property ).  I was interested in the cash flow forecast, that is why I tried to get this program working. Not worth the additional effort. This is it for me buying from Intuit.	2015-08-22

I am a Kaspersky fan for quite some fan, mostly from using their free tools in my software toolkit as a technician. I use the Anti Virus on my own machine and when buying the more expensive package it is for 3 machines, but I only needed one...so this cheaper variant was right down my alley. No infections ever since using this in conjunction with Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, which is probably overkill, but then again...no trouble with those sort of things says something. This in addition to safe practices with email and where I find myself on the web.	2015-08-21

Waiting for my license to run out to buy something else.<br /><br />It blocks everything so good that I have to turn it off all the time.  One in five Items I search for on Amazon for instance, it will block.  It is truned off now as I type this as I was searching for flashlights on Amazon and was getting blocked.<br /><br />Since it is turned off so much, I am often unprotected.  Kaspersky's response to this issue was for me to add to ignore lists, but this issue pops up all over the place.  Most commercial sights, like the add links on Google, Audible, etc.<br /><br />Other issues like scanning files are weird.  If you scan multiple items, they are all  called selective scans.  If you have a couple going, you can't tell which is which, and when done, you have to exit the GUI, and renter to see the actual names.<br /><br />Probably good protection, but very in your face and high maintenance.	2015-08-21

I bought this to go with my 3D monitor since it has the codecs I needed to play 3D movies.

The only downside is it took me a few hours to properly configure since I had never done it before.<br /><br />The only downside to the product is that it is incredibly slow and a resource hog when running.

I have been using Quicken 2012 since this was current.  This version has a kill switch that terminates its transaction download function in April 2015.  They don't make it a secret, but rather keep pointing out that an upgrade is necessary.  I have had over 40 years experience in what we now call IT, and have a degree in computer science, but although it may be hard to imagine, upgrading Quicken on my home PC has not been on the top of my priorities list.  So I procrastinated until this month when my need to complete some tax work more or less forced the issue.<br />I downloaded the 2015 Deluxe version from Amazon with the childish expectation that I could invoke a straight forward install script and within an hour or so of casual attention, I would be back in business.  I was naive.  I see from users posting on the internet that many report 2015 as full of &#34;bugs&#34;.  This was not my experience.  When all was said and done, the problems I encountered were not really product bugs, but time consuming knowledge gaps.  I won't go into the specific problems I ran into, because I suspect they are not universal.  The install script makes some strange assumptions like my system was running under XP.  Turns out there is an option accessible through the advanced properties function of the desktop icon that allows the specification of the operating system.  You just have to know its there and all makes sense.  I am sure that if you attend a proper 40 hour users class on features of Quicken 2015 this fact would be covered; perhaps on day 3 in the afternoon.  But, some of us really would like to use Quicken to record and balance our bank accounts without obtaining an advanced degree in Quickenology.  This is not a &#34;bug&#34;, just a knowledge gap for which the user is responsible.  There were several such knowledge issues throughout the upgrade.  So if you go this route, and like me you probably don't have much choice unless you want to put your entire banking on a server in the internet &#34;cloud&#34;.  Man-up and expect to take the time to learn far more about Quicken than you ever thought necessary or desirable.<br />The most positive aspect of the whole process was Quicken customer support.  I was fortunate enough to have my problem ticket picked up by a very pleasant and knowledgeable technical support woman who had attended the 40 hour users class and gotten her degree in Quickenology.  It is also worth mentioning that I did not encounter any true &#34;bugs&#34;.  My not knowing what to do is not a &#34;bug&#34;.  If you decide to upgrade from an older version of Quicken to 2015, be prepared to spend some study time.	2015-08-21

I've used Cook'n for about 6 years and have gone through several revisions.  Recently my laptop crashed and after several attempts was unable to reload Cook'n.  The Cook'n technician was very helpful and patient while assisting me vial emails, with the download on my new computer.<br />I have become dependent on this program for the organization, easy access, and ability to email recipes.  Now with the easy &#34;capture&#34; feature I can transfer a recipe from most websites to my Cook'n cookbook with ease and minimal typing.  The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star was because it seems to take a while for the program to boot up when I open it.  I'm assuming it is because of the web search interface features that it now has.  Of course that could be just my internet service.<br />Give this a try.  This company is easy to communicate with through their email and respond quickly if there happen to be any issues.	2015-08-21

I would say i did not notice any helpful improvements in this version based on the way i use the software.  A fun new feature is that it randomly drops integration with several of my accounts and i have to deactivate and re-activate to get connectivity again.  That does not always work, so i will have to long periods of time without correct data.  i have contacted the financial institutions, and they say this is a recurring issue with Quicken.  I have tried to contact Quicken, but trust me this is a useless exercise.  if you are lucky enough to talk to a human, it is likely you will know as much or more about the software than the human.  I really wish there was a decent competitor to this software in the marketplace. :(	2015-08-20

I took a chance on the this New Roxio  My DVD.  I am crainaly wired for this Program since I owned the Old One (2009). It has surpassed my Expectations!  I downloaded it (10 Min on Uverse Max (18 MBPS) then it took another 35 Min to Install). Everything is editable in Simple timelines. The difference of Flying a Kite (My DVD) and an AirBus 321( Power Director 13).  I produced and Excellent 7 Button Menu.  Excellent, Applause, Cheers,Thumbs Up.  Roxio had out done themselves.<br /><br />Spoke to Soon Everything loaded up just fine, Every Feature work perfectly came time to Burn DVD, OOOPs ! ! ! Windows 8, Dell CPU 660, Clean Install, No Previous Programs; it just would not Burn, Errors: Image failed to Burn, it will burn one small movie but will not burn 7 Movies with 2 Menus. Uninstalled Roxio, went back to my Corel Movie Factory 7 Pro., (which I wanted to get away from)  Everything worked fine. Corel Movie Factory 7 Pro is not my Favorite Software but I guess I am forced to live with it<br /><br />Sept 7, 2015:  Tried it on 3 pc 2 with Win 7.  One with Win 8.  Would not burn on any of them. I dedicated 3 PC with Windows 8 for Media Only Movie make and Audio. I reinstall  Windows 8 and Started Clean.  It worked!  I guess Roxio My DVD like to be First on the PC.  I installed a slew of other Programs including Windows Movie Maker 6.0 my favorite for Editing (I am Old School). Everything is Hunky Dory now. As a precaution I Created a Restore Point named &#34;Hunky Dory&#34;.

BEFORE you spend a hundred dollars and feel mislead and have to add yet another Critical review to the 29 that are already here.<br />And notice that a good number of the critical reviews are written by Vine Program &#34;customers&#34; .... who got this product for free and often feel guilty if they don't find SOME positive things to say in order to give a favorable review.<br />The complaints you see are fairly legitimate (for the most part) and often center around the fact that you have to spend fifty or more dollars every year to keep your program up-to-date.  Imagine if Microsoft did this to their Windows customers: make them pay $69 every year for a more up-to-date product.  And theirs is a complex operating system requiring thousands of programmers to put it together & keep it up-to-date .... and not merely a media suite like Cyberlink has.<br />No one would pay $69 EVERY YEAR for updates .... yet that's EXACTLY what Cyberlink asked ME to do (and I did it ... six months ago)  and now is asking me to do AGAIN,  six months later,  now that my MediaSuite 12 is out-of-date,  and MediaSuite 13 (the updated suite) is available.<br />Let me clearly state that again:  I had MediaSuite 11 but was &#34;convinced&#34; that I needed MS 12, so I coughed up the seventy dollars (upgrade price) and got MS 12; yet now I have to pay ANOTHER $70 to get the 12 new-and/or-improved features of MS 13.<br />Do they provide enhancements to current owners for FREE?  Free updates:  ever heard of that concept?<br />Apparently not, because now I'm in a never-ending cycle of annual updates .... but only if I want to pay for them.<br />The MS12 suite of programs seems to work fine .... but then so does Microsoft Windows XP for the last six years WITHOUT paying a dime for any upgrade.<br />Summary:  the PowerDVD is a fine product and so far has worked well for me.  I like the Photo Director's many features,  and I like Power2Go for making DVD & CD copies.  I also like MediaEspresso for converting photos & videos to other formats.<br />What has NOT worked for me is downloading videos from YouTube to play alone on my computer or tablet:  apparently I now need the $70 upgrade ... to version 13 of MediaSuite, for that to work properly.  Oh ... and it's Windows 10-ready.  Great !<br />Windows 10 is a FREE upgrade ... but I'll need to spend $70 for the newest MediaSuite to run on it.<br />I don't feel I've gotten my moneys-worth yet from MS 12  so I'll just keep using it,  for .... maybe another six months;  at which time I'll likely spend the $70 for version 13.	2015-08-20

The program is amazing for tracking all of your finances in one place. I like the budgeting and reporting features. For new users, keep in mind that like any financial tracking program, you are not going to be able to install the software and then you will instantly have all of your information at your fingertips. You need to do the set-up by adding each of your accounts, linking them to your online banking, etc. you can set it up so that the click on one button pulls all transactions from all of my accounts into Quicken. You need to be a good data steward by reconciling the information and assigning what you spend to categories. Once you do and you you get into using the program, you will have a very clear picture of your income and spending. After you use it for a while you will have historical information that you can use to see where you money is going (I spend how much on dining?!?!?!) and then create a budget within the program. I like the alert feature where I get emails for larger purchases or low account balances. I have used the bill pay feature for years an never had a problem. I upgrade by Quicken about every 2 years. With the upgrade I did form v2013 to v2015, the only gripe I have so far is that for several accounts I needed to re-link them to the financial institutions.	2015-08-20

If you’re after the short, down and dirty version, here it is…<br />This program is a complete waste of time and energy.<br /><br />Now, for the actual review.<br /><br />If you’re after a simple GPS or mapping program, others are freely available.  And this program is about as far from “simple” as any software I’ve ever written, reviewed, tested, or even seen.  It’s “EZ Nav Route Wizard” is their sad attempt at providing a simpler interface by bypassing most of their &#34;features&#34;, but it’s power is nil.  If you want simple directions from one place to another, that’s their way of giving it to you.  However, I’m baffled by why, if that’s what you’re after, you’re even considering this.  What DeLorme should have done, instead of wasting time developing a goofy simplistic option like this and sticking it in their ridiculously bulky and inefficient program is spend some time and effort simplifying the entire thing.  Imagine the control panel/dashboard of a 777 jetliner, with a seemingly infinite array of stuff, and a button in the middle that says “Fly to Chicago”.  Yeah, nice idea DeLorme.  Why not just make the thing easier to fly?  See, the bottom line is none of us is trying to fly a jetliner, we’re just trying to drive to a few places as quickly, easily and efficiently as possible, and we don’t need the dash of a 777 to do it.<br /><br />If, like many people who were abandoned by Microsoft when they stopped producing Streets & Trips even though it was consistently rated #1, you’re looking for a program that serves as a GPS and a routing program, DELORME STREET ATLAS IS NOT IT.  This program has extremely limited power in this regard – so much so that there’s no way to include it in that category.  If you, for instance, have a round trip to plan, where you know your start and end points, and have multiple stops to make but aren’t sure what order to put them in, or lets say you’re a service technician or salesman or a delivery person and you’re trying to maximize your efficiency by adjusting your start and stop times for each day, along with the duration of each of your stops, throwing sticks to the wind and trying to make sense of where they land might be more productive than using DeLorme SA.  It allows for NO start or stop time, and entering a duration for each stop is enough to make you want to hurt people.  As a comparison, in MS S&T, if you want to adjust your start time or a stop’s duration, you simply double click that address in the left pane, which lies in the same window as the place where you entered it.  Up pops the time window for that stop.  If you want to do it in DeLorme  SA, here are the steps…  make sure you’re in the Route tab.  Then click the Advanced button on the bottom left.  Then locate (scroll if necessary) the stop you’d like to adjust and click on it in the center pane.  Then click the Stop Pref’s button on the right side.  NOW you can enter a duration for your stop.  It makes me imagine a microwave where the some of the number buttons are on the left of the microwave, some are in the middle below the door, and the rest of the buttons are on the right side, and they seem to have forgotten to put a &#34;start&#34; button on the thing. And for good measure, let’s remove all the quick setting buttons from the microwave.  You know, the quick minute button and all those – they’re way too useful.<br /><br />My bottom line for this software is you’re probably only looking at it for one of a few reasons, and it just doesn’t do a good job at ANY of them.  You’re options for a Streets and Trips replacement are thin for sure, and I’m still looking.  If that’s what you’re in search of, good luck, SA is NOT IT.  If you need a simple GPS/mapping program, this is NOT IT.  Simple isn’t apparently in this software team’s vocabulary.  And if you’re looking for a routing program of any kind, with any level of efficiency to it atall, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.  I wish 0 stars was an option.  No joke.all, this is also NOT IT.<br /><br />This is, hands down, the single worst-written piece of software I’ve laid my eyes on since the Windows 3.x days.

Much better rate than from Norton directly.<br /><br />I use it on both my work and home computers.  Also on my smartphone.<br /><br />It has a really good silent mode that automatically kicks on while I am gaming.  Mostly, Norton doesn't constantly pop up asking me questions like other Antivirus's.  Its also one of the biggest companies so I don't have to worry about odd compatibility problems, I can nearly always ignore warnings that I should turn off my antivirus to install something.<br /><br />I don't like the backup or the PC maintenance that is included, but the security protection is very good in my opinion.<br /><br />Some people complain that it is resource intensive, but my slowest computer is an Intel i5 480M with 4gb of ram and my best PC is an i5 2500k at 4.3GHZ with 12 GB of ram so I've never even noticed it.

Others have said how great this product is and I can’t agree more. I had an older computer with this program on it and ended up buying a new one. I didn’t have a disk to down load the program onto the new one so I decided to email DVO support. Never thinking I would get a response in the same day I was wrong. An email came through with clear information and a link to solve my problem all within the same day. I am canning now and need these recipes that my mother handed down and she has passed now so I needed desperately to retrieve them. Mission accomplished.	2015-08-20

You might be surprised, but I actually believe Norton 360 Premier edition, which I still have at this moment on 3 machines, is a great total security suite ... That is, unless you are also running Systweak.com's excellent maintenance suite, called Advanced System Optimizer (ASO in short), which I have, and which I prefer to Norton!  I loved the Norton suite until about 6 months ago, when Norton started quarantining an executable file called Advanced System Protector (ASP), part of the ASO suite.  At first, I just downloaded the latest version of ASO and re-installed it. But again Norton snatched ASP, so I learned to get it out of quarantine and set Norton to Exclude it from scans. Norton then started snatching some of the other executable files for other purposes [based upon Heuristic scanning - they all are working files - i.e. they don't stay still as Norton demands!] and quarantined those.  So I got them out of the quarantine and excluded them.  This has carried on getting worse and worse [Norton describes them in quarantine as Gen(eration) 2 Trojans], until today despite that I hit Exclude, nothing happened, and the files went to hell, where Norton had decided they should be!  So, at last I am looking for an equally efficient Security Suite (very difficult to find), but am not prepared to use BitDefender, which is supposedy the #1 security suite, as it is, along with Norton, another Symantec suite: and I'm not about to be nice to a company that will not allow me any say in the matter, whatsoever!  To them, ASO is malware, so I advise you not to use Norton 360 if you have ASO or any other suite that might have equally good, or better (as in case of ASO), abilities to catch non virus-malware.  If you don't get Norton, try ASO to maintain and even rescue your computer if necessary (perhaps in Safe Mode if your computer will not start properly).<br /><br />You might notice that Norton when it caught some of its non-virus malware initially (over a year ago) caught itin 'ASP's Quarantine!'  After that, I *deferred to Norton and stopped running ASP, leaving Norton to do so.<br /><br />*I was more considerate than Norton!	2015-08-19

Also provides really good cookbooks that be imported as they are or into your own on-line cookbooks. The graphical component is GREAT! I love being able to easily add pictures to my recipes. I bought the program only 8 months ago and already have added over 4000 recipes into my own cookbooks / categories. That doesn't include the recipes from the Cook'n cookbooks. The only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that I thought scanning recipes from my multiple cookbooks would be easier -- but the scanning is only easy if the formatting is in one column -- two columns or more recipes just don't work -- and being a speedy typist it is easier to just type in the recipes. Once you figure out the short cuts built into the program -- you find even the typing isn't laborious. Best of all the technical support is some of the best I've encountered. I've never asked a question that I didn't get an immediate response for -- sometimes from multiple people. Also the forums and the newsletters really help to keep you informed and up to date. Finally, when I switched over to Windows 10 and my application &#34;wasn't happy&#34; they had a &#34;fix-it&#34; up immediately -- and it worked. I tried other programs in the past (on older PCs) and I tried to create my own database of recipes. This program far outstrips anything I've ever used. I have some computer skills which helps me use some of the advanced features -- but I am by no means a programmer. With a few skills at hand you will find you can build a recipe base that is not only complete, but also impressive.	2015-08-19

The main reason this gets a 2 star rating is that it attempts to add multiple other products when you install it, which my anti-malware software calls PUPs for Potentially Unwanted Programs.

Learn that alienating customers with this kind of tricky game is eventually self-defeating, and that after a while you will have earned a bad reputation and no one will want to play with you.

That said new software upgrades have brought with them some hiccups and those have taken time to resolve in my personal experience.  I have seen some of the low ratings and I see they tend to be a year old or more, back when their last huge leap forward happened and bugs were discovered.  For me it's frustrating any time a product doesn't work smoothly but I have yet to lose my recipes (thank goodness for the free cloud backing up feature that automatically backs up across my four devices).  Probably the best thing about the product is the technical support and follow up which has always been timely (say within 1-2 business days) and frankly it's only getting better with each iteration and the input the company asks for from the customers.  Is it perfect?  No.  But I challenge you to find a more feature-packed recipe software out there.  I looked and made the move to Cook'n 2 years back and even with the bumps it's been amazing and for the most part fun to use.	2015-08-19

I originally obtained a free (CD) copy of it when I purchased my Sun Oven. That was Cook'n 9, I believe. I upgraded to 10, and then 11 via the download option, directly from DVO, and not from Amazon, but Brennah at DVO asked me if I'd be kind enough to write a review. I would have written it years ago, but I didn't know until now that Amazon carried it. It never crossed my mind to check it and write a review.  I am on a restricted diet, so there are a lot of cookbooks that I can't purchase, but I do buy one occasionally and the downloading process is very easy. I have found some very good recipes, such as &#34;Apple Brownies&#34; in their apple cookbook. They are really good, and as I can't have chocolate, they are a good brownie option, they have a lot of cookbooks so it should be easy to find something that appeals, and, if not, you can always import recipes from the web, or input your own. I do purchase the different themes for my recipes, and I like being able to change the look of my recipe &#34;cards&#34;.  I don't use the nutrition or menus options, or grocery lists, so I can't say anything about that.  Prior to Cook'n, I had a folder on my Mac desk top named &#34;Cookbook&#34;  (still do), and placed category folders in it for whatever I wanted-&#34;Chicken;&#34; &#34;German;&#34; &#34;Beans;&#34; etc., and this system has branched out into several other desktop folders, with their own folders, such as &#34;Pie Cookbook;&#34; &#34;Ice Cream;&#34; and has actually gotten a bit out of hand. 8) I can save recipes from the web to any of these folders, and that's nice, but. .. .  It's very nice to be able to put my own recipes, or import recipes from the web in my Cook'n software and group them into chapters with my own chapter titles-such as &#34;Spiralized;&#34; &#34;Homemade Noodles;&#34; &#34;Sourdough;&#34; and so forth. I can use a different theme for each chapter or use whatever theme I own for any recipe. The themes are inexpensive, some are free, and you get a relevant theme when you purchase a cookbook. I can also print out any recipe, with or without it's theme, on 1 sheet, or as recipe cards. You can choose from 3x5 or 4x6, and whether you want to start with the 2nd card-in case you have a long description on the recipe that you don't want on the cards. You have to cut these apart, but there are guides and it's easy to do. If you get your recipe messy, you just print a new one and shred the old. I print out my most frequently used recipes and keep them in a little recipe box for easy access. The Mac is not in the kitchen and I don't always want to copy out the ingredients and amounts, or run back and forth.  My favorite thing is to take a picture of a recipe with my digital camera and import it to the recipe. I can also import videos, but never have. I like having my own pictures illustrate the recipe.  I've never used other cookbook software, so I can't comment upon that, but Cook'n is very thorough, they update it frequently, and I really enjoy using it, and I recommend it. I read their monthly newsletter and it's nice. You can import recipes from that. I also just have the Mac, and have had no experience with Cook'n on a tablet, or Smart Phone.  Is Cook'n perfect? No. I've had various problems with it, some small-such as a missing ingredient in a purchased cookbook recipe. You have the ability to edit even a &#34;published&#34; recipe, which I like. If you see a misspelling, you can fix it, etc., and once you know the proper amount of the missing ingredient, you can correct that in Cook'n. That's nice. Occasionally there are bigger problems, such as not being able to open it every time Apple does a major OS X update, but customer service is always responsive and there to help, and Josh, Bridger, and Brennah have been very helpful and knowledgeable about their software, and they are nice people too. Dan Oaks, the founder, and the whole team are always looking to make Cook'n better and better and do frequent upgrades.  Except for an unfortunate addiction to &#34;Free Cell&#34; in my Solitaire program, 8) I think Cook'n is my favorite software. I can recommend it. Yes, it will sometimes be frustrating until they fix a bug, and especially after Apple updates, but I really enjoy using it and miss it when it's down.  8/20/2015 UPDATE: Just this morning I received an offer via e-mail from Dan Oaks, Cook'n founder. Cook'n 12 will be released on Oct. 25th, and I received a special pre-release offer to download it now, for $19.99 less than the full price, and start using the pre-release version now. Over the next two months, there will be frequent upgrades and by the release date, I will have the full version, and won't have to learn all of the new features at once. I have taken advantage of this and have already downloaded it and it's working just fine.	2015-08-19

I've used H&R Block's tax software since 2009 when it was still Taxcut, and have never had any problems with it.  I used to do taxes by hand when I only had to take a standard deduction, but went with software after purchasing a home and switching to itemized deductions.  I don't think my taxes are all that difficult, but HR Block software just makes it so easy, and I'm typically done in a half hour or so.<br /><br />Frankly, I went with HR Block simply for the cost (they typically offer 50% discounts february-ish?), and the download from Amazon makes things so simple.  It reads my previous year's save files and imports everything for me, and I can e-file and get direct deposits.  I think the thing I love most is the donation calculator, that's been a crucial time and money saver!	2015-08-19

If you want a good program for handling you personal finances on your mac/ipad/iphone, get iBank.  It's so easy to deal with, I'm starting to second guess why I spent so many years stuck with the hostile Quicken environment in the first place (there must have been many other easier and friendlier options, even for windows).

A Norton representative graciously added the remaining 33 days on my current Norton 360 subscription to the new Norton Security 2015 upon request. I couldn't ask for more. As an added bonus, through Amazon's limited time offer, I was credited 15.00 on a different order I placed today just for purchasing Norton Security 2015 at an already low price.

Contacted DVO again and was able to download the entire App again and because the recipes were saved into the Cook’n App cloud I was able to get them all back.  There are some recipe Apps out there but none compares to Cook’n software.  It’s easy to use and has a ton of features which make this the best recipe App on the market.

It was a bad assumption on my part that software released 10 months ago would be compatible with the most recent Windows operating system . . . So there's that. Buyer be aware.<br /><br />So, since I've had good luck with buying AVG through Amazon before - did a two year license for the 2013 version - I thought I'd try a work around. I downloaded the free trial version directly from AVG then tried to activate it with the product key provided by Amazon. Got the message that the license had expired . . . interesting since I bought it four days ago.<br /><br />Never one to say die, I clicked &#34;activate&#34; anyway, which gave me an error box which sent me here - http://www.avg.com/us-en/license-expired. Apparently what Amazon gave me was a temporary sales number . . . not the worst thing ever, but if that's the case they sure as heck shouldn't call it the product key. Just saying.<br /><br />If you've made it this far, follow the directions on the AVG site to register and it will result in a usable license key. Maybe I had to go through this song and dance two years, but I can't remember - slept since then don't you know.<br /><br />I'm not sure what the difference is between the AVG 2015 I purchased through Amazon  - which comes with three application files by the way and no indication of which to use - and the version I got directly from AVG, but the Amazon purchase, even with three application files, still isn't compatible with Windows 10 even after registering and activating through AVG's website.<br /><br />Bottom line, I got antivirus protection for $20 and a lot of hoop jumping. I'm giving it the three stars for the pain in the butt factor.	2015-08-19

Technical support is much touted, but basically nonexistant.  The live chat is only BEFORE you buy it, and then not live, but a belated email response that doesn't answer your question.  Any other link to &#34;Technical Support Team&#34; only sends you to a search function that rarely finds the answer, and the &#34;Full Manual&#34; is just 4 basic steps, even though much of the information is somewhere?? because that's what is available when you search.  I found that most of the questions and problems I encountered simply trying to make a DVD of a trip were simply not answered.  If you create an account, you get no more help, but there is a link, called (for some unknown reason) &#34;Ticket&#34;, and here you can send off an email, which may or may not get answered.  There's no phone number, and the company is apparently located in Japan.  I was unable to add music period, or customize the menu in any meaningful way.	2015-08-19

Because the card sent to me, I assumed I could upgrade anytime. I can't. Their free upgrade to Premier version was over 4/20, another cheap trick they played. Then I thought I could fill out schedule D manually because I do not have many transactions. I found out that I cannot fill out schedule D even manually.<br /><br />This is a bad company. They always look for a way to gauging customers. Quicken used to let users download transactions from financial instituition. Around 2007, they blocked downloading without purchasing new version. I download my data to the software I own. Why do they ask me to buy another version. Since then, I switched to the free GNUCASH.<br /><br />I will pay for the premier gouging version since I have to finish my tax but this will be the last money Intuit see from me. I will switch to TaxCut or other product next year no matter what they claim to do in 2015.	2015-08-18

Although it can't replace our wonderful H&R tax preparation professional (in terms of friendliness and free cookies and coffee), it definitely was WAY more affordable. I felt that the software did a decent job of highlighting all of the credits that we were eligible to receive. I like that it also allowed us to file the federal return digitally, but it was unfortunate that it cost an extra $20 to file state taxes. We just printed out our state taxes and mailed it because it was much, much cheaper. We will probably go this route next year over having someone file our taxes for us.	2015-08-18

My wedding photography studio relies upon the Adobe CC for our entire studio workflow. We do our initial processing with Lightroom, and then follow up with photoshop for tweaking of our images.

Then, out of desparation, I downloaded PC Matic.  No more random rebooting!  My IT friends (who had discouraged me from buying something I had seen on TV -- but they didn't have another solution) were shocked and amazed.

My complaint is this - I had 35 days remaining on my subscription.  In the past when I purchased a renewal Norton added the new subscription onto the old remaining time. This time they blew away my remaining 35 days and only gave me a year.  Their web site say this happens when you don't go through the programs renewal prompt's. I bought this through Amazon and was directed to the Norton site to download. So beware!  No one warned me of this! I would have waited 34 days before renewing!  UPDATE - I contacted Norton Support via online chat and they easily fixed my problem and gave me back the missing 35 days.  So I am happy - I really like Norton and have used it for so many years., I seem to have less virus problems than my friends who use other software.  No complaints - so I  changed my rating to 5 stars.  Thank you to Norton support for reading & acting on my review!	2015-08-16

I got this for my brand new hp laptop after the initial trial period that it had ended.  I have had no issues with protection and it's cheaper than Norton--which is why I decided to give it a try.  However, this program has slowed down my Firefox internet browser, and it has become very irritating.<br />First, the program secretly came with another download which was not necessary to the function of the antivirus protection.  Unfortunately I can't remember what this was called, because I uninstalled it immediately as my internet was completely inaccessible with this extra program.<br />Now my browser is very slow to open, but once in, I usually don't have a problem.  Which has been fine as long as I don't need to look up something urgently.<br />So all in all, I would not recommend this program, because I can get the same good protection from Norton Antivirus without the slow internet.<br />I am sure this issue probably varies with other computer brands and internet browsers, but this is what I experienced.	2015-08-16

I do not even pretend to understand the negative comments here. I have used this product for professional information sites, educational sites, product sales sites, and most recently, numerous political candidate sites. Once you understand its simple cognitive map, it is excellent.  (Yes, I have used Dreamweaver and WebPlus 8 is better for most people.)  And, yes, your sites will come together quickly and easily. The layout is WYSIWYG. It now has the ability to do Mobile-compliant sites through the templates in the Serif Resource Guide.  The links to PayPal, Youtube, Facebook, Pinterest, etc. are quick and easy. It has a straight forward shopping cart feature.  And, developing response forms is far easier than in any other package that I have used.  Serif will even host your WebPlus-designed site for you.  As a disclaimer, I do not work for or have any relationship with Serif software.  I am a professional marketing consultant and have been so for 35 years. Many of my clients use WebPlus others use Dreamweaver, Wordpress, etc.	2015-08-16

I used Avast for a long time. Recently, I built my own computer and the only antivirus I installed was Avast. It worked very well until it started conflicting with Word and Outlook. I could not launch these products. I had had the same problem with an old computer and had tech support at Microsoft fix the problems by uninstalling Avast in order to have Outlook work in the old computer. Well, I thought that whatever it had caused that problem had been worked out for the 2015 version because my computer was working fine until a couple days ago. Well it didn't. I just called Avast's tech support and after explaining what my problem was and what I have done so far, the very condescending technician questioned how could I be sure that it was Avast causing me the problem. I explained that I had already uninstalled and reinstalled Avast 3 times and that every time I uninstalled it Word and Outlook worked fine, and when I reinstalled Avast, Word and Outlook could not be launched.  He questioned how could I be sure there were no remains from other antivirus software I had previously used, and I told him that I had build this computer myself and that Avast was the only antivirus software I had ever used. He then said that he wasn't a Microsoft technician and that he could only help me with Avast, I explained again the troubleshooting I had done, and he asked me to wait so he could contact 2nd tier technical support to find out if this is something that Avast he could help with. When he came back on the phone, he indicated that they could help (He had just said they couldn't because they weren't Microsoft technicians) but they had two support programs, a one-problem-fix for $119, or a year's subscription to Avast's tech support for $179. It's much easier and cheaper to switch to a new software!	2015-08-16

For instance, it is no longer able to reconcile a downloaded cleared check against a check entered manually, even though the check # as downloaded from my credit union is in the memo field.  Some downloaded transfers show up twice - is it because the date falls on a weekend?  Who knows.  What's the point of this software if I have to go over everything with a fine tooth comb and double check against my checking/savings account?

I am satisfied with this product for for bank accounts.  I had offline data in another product which converted accurately.  Aside from a tedious time deleting downloaded duplicate transactions to get everything in sync setup was easy.  I find the reminder system to be rather nice.  I am not satisfied with this product for investments accounts, and am on the verge of giving up an going back to spreadsheets.  After several false starts I found a decent  methodology for getting share balances and basis in agreement with accounts.  It was tedious but doable to fill in recent transfers between bank accounts and investments.  Now, I'm having a terrible time filling in the transfers between investment accounts.  I can't find a way to do it and get correct tax and account balance reporting.  I do have questions in to the support group.  FOLLOW-UP:  I found by trial and error that the reporting on investment accounts works better if the first transaction in each investment account buys shares rather than transfers funds into the account.  I also found that a fairly complicated way to make both transfers between IRA's and IRA distributions work at the same time.  So, I've upgraded my rating by a star, though I still think getting started with investments is much more difficult than it needs to be.  This has been aggravated by my inability to get investment account registers to filter like the bank account registers.  In fairness to the product, investments require lots of difficult to implement capability.  On the other hand I paid extra for the capability.	2015-08-16

Consider Google Drive or similar over Amazon Cloud Drive. I moved 14,000 files to Amazon and 4 days later the subfolder structure was gone and so were most of my files. I called support two times, talked to Joe and then Max. Nice guys that both promised to get back to me within 48 hours. It has been 3 weeks and I never heard back. There was no support ticket to track my issue, so their pleasant phone manner turned out to be simply lip service. Why waste your time or risk your data?  This is a follow-up 1 week after I wrote the review. I am using Expandrive to access my Amazon Cloud Drive and maybe this is the issue.	2015-08-16

I love the idea of having apps on various devices and all syncing with the installation on my PC, and the $69 price tag for a year's subscription seemed quite reasonable. And there was a &#34;Get Office Now&#34; on my start menu. The stars seemed to align.<br /><br />I signed up for a Microsoft account and then selected the one month free trial just to make sure everything would work right. I installed the office suite, and ... none of the applications worked. Several of them just did nothing when I clicked on them. Word (the app I would use the most) just said it couldn't start, and then Excel (the app I would use the second most) told me there wasn't enough memory in my machine to load, and to install the 64-bit version instead.<br /><br />According to the Office installation screens, the 32-bit version is installed by default to preserve compatibility with some plug-ins.<br /><br />I uninstalled the 32-bit version of Office and installed the 64 bit version instead. This took a little finagling as I had to go into my Microsoft subscriptions and delete the PC installation, which was completely counter-intuitive. It's the same computer. Surely, MS collects identifying information (such as MAC address) to prevent software piracy. Why wouldn't MS know I was installing onto the same computer using the same account?<br /><br />Once installed, the 64-bit applications worked just fine, hence the two stars I'm willing to give this shoddy roll-out. However, because I had already registered my trial version, I couldn't use them. Office kept telling me I had already used a promotional license, and would have to pay for the product.<br /><br />It's been years since Bill Gates offered to resign from MS after a particularly shoddy version of Office for Mac. Decades later, and MS still can't get it together to make a promotional offer of its own software that ships withWindows 10 work on Windows 10. Microsoft plays a numbers game, and if the software works for you, then great. If it doesn't, you are totally hosed. This isn't great technology; it's poor technology. It's poor marketing, and it's poor customer relations.<br /><br />My advice is to skip Office 365 for now. Let other users suffer the heartbreak of application crashes and talking to call centers half-way around the world. I'm sure they'll get it sorted out. They just can't be bothered to do that BEFORE releasing it to the public. It's the production suite brought to you by the folks who gave you Clippy, Microsoft BOB, and Windows ME. They specialize in hits and misses. This release is a miss.	2015-08-15

The general ledger for check/debit transactions is reflective of &#34;old school&#34; handwritten entries & isn't really needed any longer because journals are no longer a part of the equation. Just showing one transaction on the line entry is necessary, not two. i.e. check in the amount of 19.00 posted and directly after line entry -19.00 then following balance is so much more than a person needs to &#34;see&#34;. It is obvious in the beginning of the line item that describes what type of transaction it is in order to understand if it is a debit or credit, lots more program writing than needed to also include the entry reflected twice as either a debit or credit....silly. Your previous programs were not written like this and I think I prefer the way it was in the past. Overall? I LOVE Quicken and have used it for 20 years.

Okay, are you doing anything? Apparently not based on the many reported problems with this software. I added to my case on Iolo's customer support.

As a previous Microsoft Money user, the transition to Quicken was not bad. It has more compatible functionality with online banks, which is definitely a plus. But, surprisingly, Money has features that Quicken does not. A big one is Bill Reminders. In Quicken, you can list them, but unless your bills are the same dollar amount every time (i.e., not utilities), it cannot match them. You have to manually follow up on supposedly &#34;overdue&#34; bills and delete them. What a pain!	2015-08-15

As a professional photographer I rely on Photoshop and Lightroom (And Premiere).<br />One of the most hear misconceptions is that the CC is more expensive than it was in the past and that you need internet for acces.<br /><br />Both are not true.<br />You can acces your files anywhere (also when you don't have internet), so Ps and Lr always work.<br />The costs are incredibly low compared with the old situation.<br /><br />And let's be honest if you can't afford 10.00 per month for Ps and Lr... how could you EVER afford it when it was sold as a retail product.<br />Most people have problems with the fact it's now a subscription, for me this is ideal, the updates are much more frequent and the CC suite is constantly updated, plus the amount of mobile apps, downloadable content etc. is just mind boggling compared to a few years ago.<br /><br />If you skip two times starbucks a month you can work with the best software in the world for photo editing and a lot more...<br />For me the CC is the perfect solution for a very low price (we pay three times as much for our bookkeeping software :( )	2015-08-15

This is one of very few reasonably priced mapping software products I have found that will map a virtually unlimited number of stops on a delivery route.  Calculates efficient delivery routes with the ability to hand-adjust them when you choose.  Good import function from Excel or Access through Excel format.<br /><br />However, Microsoft no longer supports this product.  Hasn't for some time.  Therefore, maps may be out of date - There are some addresses in my city that it just gets flat wrong, placing them more than a mile away from the correct location and the only way to correct that is to drag the map point to it's correct location - EVERY TIME you map that address. Rather tedious. One significant shortfall of S&T for me is that there is no Export function to move delivery sequence results back into my database.  If it had that function I would not be searching for an alternative replacement product.	2015-08-15

Windows 10 was designed to correct the design mistakes of Windows 8 and upgrade the popular Windows 7. In other words, it was to be the successor to Windows 7 with additional features and flashy designs.<br />.<br />In a nutshell, the new product does not confuse users with radical changes. True to legacy, the familiar features are present. There is a START BUTTON. Right click the START BUTTON will get a menu of familiar pages such as CONTROL PANEL, VIEW DEVICES AND PRINTERS, CHANGE DESKTOP BACKGROUND, and others. However, there are problems that discourage consumers to switch. They include the following:<br />.<br />1. Installing the Home Premium version was a complete failure. The free download upgrade version was impossible. After clicking the agreement box, the rotating blue arrow continued in an endless loop for hours - signifying that installation was taking place. After waiting three hours, I clicked the CANCEL BUTTON. Next, I downloaded the iso version on the Microsoft website, burned the image on DVD, and install that. On the final stage, the program &#34;locked up&#34; - typing the access password was impossible. A hard boot destroyed the installation and forced the computer to revert back to the previous Windows 7 OS. I tired again - three times - with the same results. . . . In the end, I gave up.<br />.<br />2. The Professional version did not experience the above. So, I was able to test it. Again, there were significant problems. Software compatibility was a major one. Firewalls, software drivers, and anti-virus programs did not work, especially Bit Defender and Commodo Internet Security. Microsoft Office 2003 and 2000 crashed and froze the computer. Macrium Reflect tried to construct an image of my Windows 10 partition. At 97% completion, the program hanged and everything froze. Hardware compatibility was &#34;the great game changer.&#34; My $3,500 Epson scanner was totally useless.<br />.<br />3. &#34;Teething problems&#34; were common as little errors erupted every week. The OS upgrades on Tuesdays would solve one error, but they also created new ones. One major irritant was a booting loop. Last week, the OS kept rebooting over and over until the fifth cycle. The user was stuck with the problem until the next Tuesday OS upgrade. There was no guarantee that anything would work afterwards. If not enough complaints were relayed to Microsoft engineers that week or if the problems were too complicated, the &#34;bugs&#34; were not fixed. Issues like these could be avoided if users were able to refuse the most recent OS upgrade and go back to the previous setting. Unfortunately, there was no option. Windows 10 forcefully made changes.<br />.<br />4. Missing were many useful programs that came with Windows 7, especially Windows Multimedia Player and gadgets. The former was essential. Click a video file, and it automatically played. The latter series were very useful. In front of me on the computer screen were over-sized icons that provided instant information: analog clock, calendar, weather, local weather reports for the week, memory and CPU usage, internet download and upload information, latest news flashes, and anything imaginable. In short, it is very hard to live without these.<br />.<br />5. If you are going to upgrade instead of installing from scratch, you need to commit two to three hours of uninstalling almost all of your old software and hardware drivers to avoid incompatibility problems. Almost everything has to go except Window 7, motherboard utilities, and video card drivers. Next, you activate the Windows 10 upgrade. This is followed by reinstalling everything.<br />.<br />6. The other choice - a clean install - is also a hassle. The booting hard drive has to be reformatted to GPT or Windows will not install.<br />.<br />7. The biggest concern is spelled out in Microsoft's 12,000 word Service Agreement: &#34;We will access, disclose and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails, other private communications or files in private folders), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to protect our customers or enforce the terms governing the use of the services.&#34;<br />.<br />In a nutshell, this gives MS the legal right to record and preserve all of your computer activities, internet searches, emails, and writings. There are two possible reasons for this. First, the company is able to collect the data and sort them. It is able to sell the information to marketers, who will directly focus their sales pitches to a ready market. Second, I suspect that this is necessary for the operation of CORTANA. This new HELP feature is like SIRI for the IPhone. You ask a question, and the computer will quickly provide the answer. In preparation, CORTANA has to record all of the user's computer activities and build an indexed database on the information. A quick search for the possible answers will enable CORTANA to provide a ready response if a question is asked in the future.<br />.<br />My biggest fears are the unknown and unpredictable possibilities that may come back and haunt the user in the future. Legally, the government and courts can force Microsoft hand over this information. So if I accidentally stumbled into a porn or ISIS site, or wrote notes for a school debate on terrorism, or received an unwanted email advertisement from a firm that specializes on questionable tax shelter plans, or received a misrouted TWITTER message from a militia group advocating the assassination of the President, can this provide the evidence against me in a future divorce hearing or trigger a FBI or IRS or Secret Service investigation? Legally, this is &#34;probably cause&#34; and can be used against you.<br />.<br />So if you want to use the &#34;latest and greatest&#34; OS, wait six months until all the &#34;bugs&#34; are removed - Windows 10 is not ready for &#34;prime time.&#34; For all others, especially Windows 7 users, it is folly to upgrade if your present operating system works without any problems. For me, I do not want to be a guinea pig to test MS's faulty OS system and locate the &#34;bugs.&#34; I do not want to spend hours installing and troubleshooting my computer. I am not spending thousands of dollars to purchase software updates and another Epson scanner for the privilege of using the latest Microsoft product. More important, I do not want to be spied on and have every activity preserved.<br />.<br />Unless you have endless hours to waste, a fortune to spend, and your computering activities recorded, this operating system is not for you.<br />.<br />.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />.<br />.<br />AN OBSERVATION<br />.<br />The marketing of Windows 10 is like watching the movie GROUNDHOG DAY. Like previous introductions of new and improved Microsoft operating systems, technical writers rave on the new features, speed, and flashy screen designs. Techkies join the bandwagon and spread the excitement. Consumers buy the &#34;new and improved product.&#34; Three to five years later, the process repeats with the introduction of the next technological wonder.<br />.<br />This is not reality. An operating system is like electricity. It should be dependable, safe, and problem-less. More important, it's only function is to seamlessly operate in the background and allow users to connect and activate their equipment and software. It makes them work without any issues.<br />.<br />Just image the chaos if your electrical company operated like Microsoft. Every three to five years, the utility wants to be on the cutting edge of technology and improves its product. So, firm makes small changes to voltage, varies the watts transmitted, and alters the outlet socket design. Many older appliances and electrical equipment have to be repurchased for newer models in order to cope with these upgrades in service. In the process, consumers spend thousands of dollars. For a time, the new equipment suffers constant breakdowns and need repairs because of the new electrical changes.<br />.<br />The above scenario is my justification for not upgrading. For me, it is silly to buy another $3,500 scanner, update several thousand dollars worth of software, find an inferior replacement for Windows Media Player, and give up my gadgets - which I use everyday. . . .It is sillier to do this every three to five years, because pundits and their followers hype the next new product - &#34;You can not live without this.&#34;<br />.<br />To switch over to Windows 10, I am giving up problem-less computering for what? . . .

The only advantage for switching is the honor of being on the cutting edge of technology. I have played this game with the Apple IIC, CX, E, and their variations. I have also gone through the upgrade chaos with Windows 3.0, ME, and Vista.

That would be acceptable if they could have the decency to release bug-free products and significant new features. But they don't. The product is slower at every release, and where they could improve - with their reports, for instance - they don't. There is no way of archiving in a simple and effective way your oldest transactions in order to try to speed up the product. I chatted with their customer service during 60mn just to realize that I had been waiting for an answer that does not exist. I have thus decided to drop this product which was asking me to spend hours when I want to update my portfolio or even enter a simple transaction. Software is supposed to simplify your life, not complicate it. I don't know what the guys at Intuit are thinking about, but it looks to me like they see their customers as cash cows. Good for them, but without me.	2015-08-14

I'm kicking myself in the butt, usually before I buy anything I check on Amazon before I buy, if it has good reviews, I'll buy it, if not, I'll 86 it. Sadly, I didn't do that with Wondershare PDF to WORD. It is a total waste of money. The funny thing, I tried it on a document I didn't need to edit and it worked just fine. I tried everything I can think of to get the document I need to edit converted into an editable version WORD. It converts the PDF to WORD no problem, but that's all it does, it won't convert to a editable WORD document. I've sent emails to their Support site, tried to make a call and talk to someone who might be able to help, NOTHING! I just wish I bought this product through Amazon, I'd have a damn good chance of getting a refund, Amazon has been amazing with their Customer Support. Like I said, I'm kicking myself for not checking with Amazon before buying. Not only is there no customer support, but the product is a worthless piece of dung as well. DO NOT BUY!!!!  After I wrote this review I received an email from Wondershare stating they will try to help me solve the problem. OK, I'll give them a change. I was surprised to hear from customer service, if the problem can be solved I'll change my opinion and re-write about my experience.

I illustrate children's books and Painter is an important part of my arsenal of digital tools. I wouldn't want to be without it.<br /><br /> It seems like many new to digital art wonder whether they should purchase Photoshop or Painter or something else. Painter is a necessary tool if you want to create art more like the &#34;old-fashioned&#34; way (like you would in a real life art studio with real paints, etc.) and are not intimidated by having to learn a very robust, and deep program. Painter is the program where digital tools behave more like their counterparts in the real world. Watercolors &#34;dry&#34; on your digital canvas, you can mix oil paints just like you would real oil paints in an art studio, and the digital chalks have that &#34;chalky&#34; texture. Even the digital markers behave like real ones - going on somewhat transparently with overlapping strokes that become more opaque as you continue coloring. Painter has tons of tools with endless variations and the ability to customize to your heart's content. You get to play with acrylics, airbrushes, charcoal & conte, chalk, crayons, gels, gouache, liquid inks, pastels, sumi-e, watercolors, and lots more. There are even particle brushes that create amazing effects like smoke & dynamic fur, as well as pens that paint patterns of flowers, or chain, or even neon. There are also tools that mimic famous painter's styles like Van Gogh, Seurat, impressionist style, and so on. You could sit and &#34;play&#34; all day and not even go over ever possibility of every tool! You can even change all of the settings for each tool, to make it something really unique, and save your settings to use again and again. There are over 25 categories of brushes, each with a multitude of variants. I looked up the official number of brushes, and there are 806 (compare that to the 126 brushes in Painter Essentials)!! Look at the screenshot I uploaded of some of the paint marks I made with various brushes. I went through the categories and painted on the canvas with different ones, so you can see just a tiny bit of the options you'd have with Painter. It's like having an art store on your computer. You can even pick out different types of paper / canvas (smooth, textured, colored, whatever).<br /><br />You don't have to be a traditional artist to use Painter, though. Painter also has the capability to take a photograph and turn it into a painting using the multitude of brush options via cloning options. It also has tracing paper! Quick cloning is a time-saving tool I sometimes use to make some of the backgrounds for my illustrations. The computer does a lot of the work to turn a picture into a painting (in seconds or minutes) with all sorts of options to make things unique, but you can fine-tune it and add your own personal touches, so that it's not totally cheating, lol. The 2nd screenshot I uploaded (of a flower) is something I made using the tracing paper and the cloning tools. It took me about 4 minutes to create. With Painter you can create art that is nearly impossible to create in the &#34;real world&#34;. And it has an undo button. ;-)<br /><br />There are also Photoshop style tools, layer capabilities (like many layers of glass that overlap that you can draw/paint on), selection tools, vector pen tools, a paint bucket (to dump color or patterns like plaids and so on onto your canvas or into a selection), color correction, and other digital tools you can find in just about any digital photo / art program. You really don't want to use Painter for photo editing though. That's more of a job for Photoshop. Painter is for…well painting, lol, (and drawing, sketching, airbrushing, etc.). You can paint and draw in Photoshop, but that's not its original design purpose. I use both (along with Manga Studio / Clip Studio Paint, Krita, Illustrator, and Sketchbook Pro). Theyare all important tools that excel in different things.  Another reviewer likened the Painter and Photoshop to a hammer vs. a screwdriver, and he's spot on. I have to have Photoshop to accomplish specific tasks Painter just can't do (a lot of image manipulation and that type of thing). I have to have Painter to mimic the real life painting techniques that Photoshop just can't do. Bottom line is if you want to paint, get Painter. If you want to do digital art that is more about manipulating images, get Photoshop (if you can stomach the nasty subscription model they moved to - I personally am sticking with Photoshop CS6, until I can find an alternative).<br /><br />Please note that (in my opinion / experience) Painter is NOT the best for inking (think comic book style drawing). I've found that Manga Studio (which is also known as Clip Studio Paint) is better for that, in that the lines are nice and better stabilized (there is a slider that will make it so it will auto correct tiny jitters as you draw). It is also not the best if you just want to sketch. Getting Painter to sketch is overkill and there are other programs that are better for drawing. I think Painter is truly BEST suited for PAINTING (watercolors, oils, acrylics, etc.).<br /><br />If you are NEW to digital art, I recommend getting your feet wet, first, in something like Sketchbook Pro (or Painter Essentials) that is much more inexpensive and easier to use. Sketchbook Pro is easy enough for a child to use. You can literally sit down, open it up and start sketching and drawing in no time (you can take a look at my review here on Amazon, under my profile). The basic tools are intuitive from the outset and It's very freeing not to have to learn all sorts of complicated controls & commands, etc. , especially for a beginner. You can try it to see if you like digital art, and then, if you do, you might be interested in pursuing something like Painter to take a step in a more professional direction.  Painter is a quite a bit more of a challenge with endless options that can be daunting to a new user, but Corel offers lots of free video tutorials to help you get started. Also, if you would like to learn how to use it quickly, I recommend getting a month's subscription to Lynda.com. They have a great beginning video course on how to use Painter that goes over the various tools and how to get the most from them. I've been using Painter for about 15 years, and even I learned something from the Lynda.com video for the 2015 version.<br /><br />Please note, if you are interested in purchasing Painter, you really need a digital tablet to draw directly on such as a Wacom Intuos, or Cintiq. This is not a program to use with a mouse (imagine writing your name on paper with a tool shaped like a mouse!). You need a digital pen in hand. I have used it with both of the above. Painter works very well with Wacom tablets and responds to the tilt, speed, pressure, etc. of the Wacom pens. There are less expensive tablet options (Yiynova, Huion, etc.) but they are not (in my opinion) as good as Wacom. If you have something like a Surface Pro, you can already draw directly on the screen. Anyway, the point is, you need something to draw with other than a mouse. ;-)<br /><br />If you already have Painter and are wondering if an upgrade is worth it, for me it was. The brushes are MUCH faster (no more lag time), the brushes track better, and the new particle brushes are amazing (and fun to play with, lol). I recommend trying the 30 day free trial to see if the upgrades are worth it, which is what I did. The increase in speed alone was so worth it for me (I'm on a bit of an older computer so lots of my art programs lag if I have a really big brush, etc.).<br /><br />Also, don't be afraid to get Painter as a digital download if you are like me and want the instant gratification of receiving your purchase right then and there, lol. I've purchased software downloads from Amazon numerous times, with no hitches.<br /><br />If, after reading this review, you have any questions, please ask via the comment button below. I'll be happy to try and help out!<br /><br />Bottom line: Painter is a worthwhile program that is the best at mimicking real life media, but especially paint. If you want to take your digital art to the next level, or want something that will behave more like the &#34;real&#34; stuff, and less like digital tools, this is what you are looking for. Just keep in mind that there is a LOT to learn, and if you are a beginner you might be best served by a less expensive program, to start with. Painter is an amazing tool that helps me create my illustrations, and I highly recommend it, with that particular reservation in mind.

I have paid so much more when Illustrator was a separate application or when I had to purchase the Creative Suite to get the tools I needed. Maybe those other's do not remember the $1200 and more  prices for the applications which would renew about every two years, and then you had to pay an upgrade of about $600.<br />This works out better mathematically. And with the subscription plan, all the latest updates and improvements are easier to install.<br />If you use the application for a hobby, consider the costs of other hobbies - anyone played golf lately? Or how about skiing.<br />I use Illustrator for so many projects I cannot imagine not having it handy. The engineers at Adobe have spent a lot of time improving the application since I first learned to use it as Illustrator 88 and paid a lot more for it. However, because I use several of the other applications, the best deal is the full Creative Cloud. That way I have a full version of Acrobat and more. And the full version of Acrobat has so many uses these days.	2015-08-14

When you do your first photo with your watermark,  dragging and dropping your next photo will use the watermark of the first, if that is what you want.  Ebay uploads of photos does not like this watermarks software “jpeg” format.  I had to load the photo in my Print Shop software and  export as a new “jpeg” format to get it to work on Ebay.<br /><br />My best advice!

(sales)	I'm totally confused by the high rankings this software received!  First and foremost (unless I'm doing something wrong) it doesn't allow you to upload your &#34;existing&#34; resume for editing or auditing, which is PRIMARILY why I bought it!  You have to start from scratch and it only uploads or downloads with it's own file extension (.rsm), so you can't open or edit it in Microsoft Word!  So how are prospective employers supposed to open it??<br /><br />In addition, the suggestions and instructions seemed rather remedial and entry level to me.  I'm an experienced technical sales professional, and after being out of the game for a few years I was looking to sharpen my resume.  When I selected just &#34;sales&#34; as an occupation to see what came up, there were no examples listing B2B or Business to Business which is a very common term and phrase for a lot of sales positions.  There were however plenty of examples like &#34;roofing sales&#34;, or my favorite &#34;Toilet Preparations Sales Representative&#34;.  I found Medical Sales Person and the example was in a very basic format and just listed a long list of bullet statements, which were also very basic and non-descriptive in my opinion.  I will say that the seem to have a limitless choice of &#34;designs&#34; (many of which were over the top), but what's the point if your content is weak.<br /><br />So my overall opinion is this software is targeting entry level positions or job seekers that have no resume building skills whatsoever.  I'm quite disappointed that I can't get my money back since it's software, so I may just save it for when my 9 month old son goes for his first high school job at the local grocery store!	2015-08-14

They apparently outsource to India and the people designated to help you are absolutely clueless.  I was using Symantec Endpoint for years with no issue and just switched to Norton.  All of a sudden I can no longer share folders between 2 home PC's.  I disable smart firewall, and voila - problem solved.  I changed 2 settings to cure the issue: 1) I set Network Trust to &#34;Full Trust&#34; and 2) I added each PC as a Trusted Device on the opposite PC's list.  This works for a few hours, and then the &#34;Smart&#34; firewall blocks access again without any warning or change in the settings.  I chatted with support online and they spent 45 mins giving me the same fix, without understanding that I already took the prescribed steps 3 times.  Next I called for support.  I explained the issue, the man took a few minutes and told me &#34;sorry, I can't handle this - I will have to escalate your case (CASE # 23482090) and have a supervisor call you back.  I've been waiting all day for a call and nothing.  This is simple, straightforward functionality - Folder Sharing between 2 home PC's.  I had no issues with this using Endpoint (a more complex program), but with Norton it just doesn't work properly and no one can tell me why.  Other than that the product seems to work fine, but does a few strange things like telling me that threats were dealt with without ever letting me find out what those supposed threats were.  Also, pop ups get annoying at times - especially those for browser plugin protections.	2015-08-14

If you were starting as a new user on this product it would probably be worth 4 stars.<br /><br />1. The conversion tool for converting my Windows Quicken file to be compatible with the Mac Quicken did not work. Based on some internet searching it appears it is not compatible with Windows 8. I had to open a help ticket with Quicken, upload the file to their site, then download a file they manually converted. After conversion I had to do some significant work to make sure my investment account balances were correct after the first synchronization. In the end things worked out, and I assume their process is secure, but I was not that comfortable with uploading all my financial data to their site.<br /><br />2. This software is not exactly equivalent to the windows version. I will be able to work with it, but there definitely was a moment I considered giving up and just sticking with keeping a Windows computer around the house just for Quicken. Account reconciliation is completely different in this version, and makes no sense to me. Transfers between accounts do not automatically link. This confused me at first, but ultimately I think this is ok. As far as I can tell this is missing asset allocation reports for the investments, which could be a deal-breaker if I can not figure out how to use them in this version, so I may still abandon this product. Long story short, plan to make adjustments to the way you use Quicken if you switch to the Mac version.	2015-08-13

I used to upgrade every other version of Creative Suite, so I can definitely appreciate the negative reviews of CC. However, since I've starting working with CC, my workflow and my creative capabilities have increased. I love the ability to immediately upgrade individual Adobe desktop apps, and have the ability to install and log onto more than one computer. One of my favorite options of CC is the accessibility of my photos from anywhere, on any device!!! I find myself sharing photos from my desktop computer with my iPhone/iPad apps. I use it to share photos with clients, or to transport files when I do not have an external drive. It's as simple as dragging and dropping a file into a folder on my computer. I use Lightroom extensively for organizing my photography, so I love the accessibility of LR Mobile. I can take photos on my iPhone, and sync them via the cloud with my LR catalog on my desktop computer. In addition to sharing and syncing photos, I am also fond of Syncing Settings from apps such as Photoshop, so I always have my personal Actions and custom brushes available on any computer I happen to be using. I never have to worry about recreating any of them, or making sure I have them on an external drive. This also applies to fonts [Type Kit] that I am using on designs, which are shared between Illustrator, Photoshop, Muse and InDesign, and included in CC.  Most of the negative comments found here have to do with the subscription pricing, and I can appreciate where those people are coming from, but you get so much for the dollar.	2015-08-13

I was reluctant to move as I loved the organization of Aperture over Lightroom. Sure LR had more editing features, but for me organization was more important than editing.<br /><br />What sold me was now that LR6 has the ability to use search for smart albums. No prior version of LR could use that feature. If you have several thousand of pictures, it is a challenge to find them.<br /><br />I had tossed between the CC and the standalone version of LR. My decision was the cost per features did not warrant the price, and I prefer to have access to my photos without being restricted in a subscription contract. I compared the full releases dates on LR, and that buying standalone versions ever time it is released is cheeper than a CC subscription, as long as they price is the same as of this writing.<br /><br />Here are some of the other features I found useful and improvement from Aperture<br />-Cropping using the Golden Rule Ratio<br />-Key wording suggestions<br />-Extensive developing editing features.<br />-Curves shows how the tone light will be effected without having to guess<br />-Powerful adjustments. I have been able to recover blown out highlights, grain, and soft focused images in LR that was never possible in Aperture. These does make LR somewhat aggressive, so you have to be careful not do go to heavy handed with adjustments.<br />-Auto Exposure and Leveling<br /><br />I also appreciate how LR has slowly taken the highlight features of Aperture such as facial recognition, GPS mapping, and printing books.<br /><br />There are a few features that I missed that are not quite available in Aperture<br />-Full screen editing, when you use full screen you can only adjust tags like stars and colors, but that is about it. I loved the full screen editing using Aperture<br />-Zooming in at 100%. It takes LR longer to show these views than Aperture. I find this critical for choosing the sharpest image of a set that I shoot. This slows down the process for me<br />-No shortcut key for Purple color Label<br />-There is no Orange color label like in Aperture<br />-You cannot stack images in Collection albums, only directly in the Folders box. These slows down the editing process<br />-Deleting pictures is somewhat clunky as you have to click in a dialog box or use Shift+Control+Command+Delete. This is somewhat clunky. I liked how Aperture had a Deleted Trashcan folder to make sure if you made a mistake. In LR, you have to go to the actual Trashcan in your Mac to recover it. I have made several mistakes accidentally deleting pictures<br />-You can only compare original master and the adjustment in Development mode. Aperture was able to do it in any mode<br />-Aperture had a means of adjusting keyboard shortcuts. I have not yet seen a means how to adjust shortcuts or add them for missing ones (like tag Purple)<br /><br />While LR is not completely the same as Aperture, it has enough similar features and an extensive more than Aperture that made it fun to use some days.<br /><br />That said, I have had it crash on my me a few times. Aperture had never crash on me. It is a small thing, but annoyance.<br /><br />For a side note, I got the Exporter for Aperture on the Mac App Store. This add made it extremely easier for you to migrate your photo into a different platform such as Lightroom. I highly recommend it for those changing from Aperture and moving to LR.<br /><br />Hope this helps other Aperture uses for making a decision.e of a set that I shoot.

When I cleared some space (two times the restore size to be safe) things worked just fine.  The product pulled 25GB of deleted data off the phone, so I needed just over 50GB free to do a proper recovery.   edit:  Update.  I've since tried the same product on two other phones that were supposed to be supported, and the software was unable to find the phones, even with all the developer mode/USB settings tweaked correctly.  Seems to be spotty with which phones it will run on, but did work on 1 of 3.	2015-08-13

I cannot get the auto resume to work in General settings for any DVD. I know that it is not going to do it for Blu-Ray DVDs, but my standard DVDs will not auto resume. It will not memorize where I was at and will never keep track of where I left off. It won't prompt for auto resume and it won't come back to the last scene either. The Ultra11 version still works fine on the same Computer (I did not delete that version yet until I see if Ultra15 is going to work out). I sent my complaint to Customer Service and it requested some technical information which I fully sent to the Technician but all he did was advise me to go into General setting & select auto resume! I explained to him that I Already informed him that it doesn't work. He just wasted my time & it takes days before they reply back. Poor Customer service.He doesn't seem to know what he is doing. It is very annoying and I find myself going back to Version 11 Ultra to play DVDs when I play a DVD & do not have time to finish the Movie & quit early. The DVD always resumes in Ultra 11. If you have the same problem all I can say is that Ultra 11 works fine. Cyberlink's Customer service in the past was better, but now it is awful.	2015-08-12

When I have talked to tech support they just want to sell me something else instead of helping to solve the problem. The first problem I had was when I signed up to recv the free month and  then while still in the process was offered a discount price of $32 so I purchased it. The program was installed as the free month and didn't  recognize that I had purchased it, even though I had used the correct activation code they sent me. I spoke to about 6 different techs over the course of 2 weeks, who just wanted to sell another product and weren't listening to the fact that I had a receipt showing that I had purchased it. Finally I spoke to a knowledgeable guy and he immediately walked me through a process to eliminate the free app and immediately the app I purchased was available.

I need this for work, and can get a one-time cost approved, but not an annual subscription. So I am stuck on CS6 forever, apparently. I don't understand why Adobe would shoot themselves in the foot like this. I am having to evaluate various other software to perform the same functions for future use, and banging my head.  I hate to admit it, but almost all of Adobe's CS6 programs are better. At least you can still sometimes find CS6 suite for sale on Amazon.    Update: Anyone else notice that many of the recent 4 and 5 star reviews are from people who have only written one review? Well, except for the guy who wrote a book on using Adobe products and, astoundingly, states the price is $50 per year instead of $50 per month. Are they now having to pay people to leave good reviews to counteract all the one star reviews, like a shyster vendor? Has this once great software company really fallen so far?    Update2: I have discovered Fakespot.com (its chrome extension) to analyze Amazon reviews to see if they are fake. This product ranks a \\"D\\" :[...]  I knew it. Products that rank this low on fakespot usually have a 4+ star rating.	2015-08-12

Well the reviews I read where accurate - but I went ahead and thought I'd give it a try anyway. Now I need my money back because it will not install on my PC.  I tried multiple times. It kept saying something about OOPS and then trying to fix something and then it would just hang on .NET 4.0.  I contact support and got pretty much the same run-around as others in these reviews.  I then did a search and found the download from Microsoft for  .NET 4.0 - and ran the installer and the result as I expected is that it won't install because I have .NET 4.5 installed and need it for other software so I can't un-install 4.5 to be able to install 4.0 and apparently Quicken 2015 won't work with .NET 4.5.  So I need a refund !  Geesh !  What a sad state of affairs from a company and product that used to be outstanding. I had been using Quicken since it was a DOS program and not even Windows yet.  There installation program alone looks like a kindergartener wrote it.  Sad sad sad !!<br /><br />Here's the transcript from what I suspect was a robot support program.<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:19:23 a.m.<br />  Welcome to Quicken Support. My name is Marjorie. I will be happy to assist you today. Please give me a moment while I review your question.<br />  8:19:39 a.m.<br />  Hi Chuck! Thank you for patiently waiting. I appreciate it. How are you doing today?<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:19:57 a.m.<br />  Fine except for this problem<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:20:29 a.m.<br />  I see. Don't worry, I'm here to help you.<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:20:39 a.m.<br />  Ok ...<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:20:53 a.m.<br />  By the way, If I got your concern correctly, you can't install your Quicken software, is that right?<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:21:39 a.m.<br />  That is correct. I just purchased from Amazon yesterday. Tried 2 or 3 times last night and again this morning. Keeps hanging on .NET 4<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:22:07 a.m.<br />  I see.<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:22:55 a.m.<br />  I do not have a CD - this is a download installation.<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:23:37 a.m.<br />  Just to inform you Chuck, before we completely install Quicken. We have system requirements.<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:23:45 a.m.<br />  This is the download file. QW15HAB_B00M9GTEPA.exe<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:23:53 a.m.<br />  And it requires a .NET 4<br />  8:24:14 a.m.<br />  So we will need first to install the .Net 4<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:24:42 a.m.<br />  Then why doesn't Intuit install .NET 4 and by the way that is an old version of .NET I have .NET 4.5 installed on this pc.<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:25:34 a.m.<br />  It's not from Intuit Chuck, it is on your computer that you must have before you install Quicken.<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:26:04 a.m.<br />  I am a computer professional. I know what .NET is and who it is from...<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:26:20 a.m.<br />  Yes Chuck.<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:26:40 a.m.<br />  Is this a real person or a robot ?<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:26:54 a.m.<br />  I'm a real person.<br />  8:28:02 a.m.<br />  I do understand you Chuck but Quicken 2015 requires .Net 4<br />  8:28:20 a.m.<br />  For us to install Quicken completely.<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:28:22 a.m.<br />  Do you have a link to send me to download and install what's needed? Is it .NET v 4.0 or ?<br />  Marjorie P<br />  8:28:52 a.m.<br />  Yes, it's .NET 4.0.<br />  8:29:04 a.m.<br />  Please hold on Chuck.<br />  Chuck Atkinson<br />  8:30:37 a.m.<br />  I really don't understand if this required then why doesn't INTUIT provide the software with the installation. It is a redistributable package available from Microsoft.<br />Marjorie P<br /><br />  8:32:27 a.m.<br />  For you to install that requirement Chuck, you need to contact the Microsoft.<br />  8:32:43 a.m.<br />  They have also an official page.<br />  8:32:57 a.m.<br />  I'm looking for it.<br />  8:33:11 a.m.<br />  Here's the link, https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/<br /><br />Chuck Atkinson<br /><br />  8:33:11 a.m.<br />  You know what !!! - This is ridiculous. Now I know it's true what I read in the reviews on Amazon.

Should've seen the storm brewing right from there because nothing is ever easy. So once installed and I did a little exploring to get a good feel for the software and I was actually enjoying myself and quickly started falling for it when out of know where my screen blacks out...after a few minutes of trying to figure out if a cable managed to come loose or something went wrong my screen comes back to life and shows my tower running threw boot up. Thinking this was a minor fluke I dealt with frequent crashes and having to constantly unplug and re-plug in my network adapter because after every crash it would know longer recognize the driver so it would have to reinstall every time this happens and I'm talking LIGHT use ranging from a couple tabs open on web browser to just sitting on the dashboard. So after a week of dealing with this and only one update (which was released the next day the OS was released another red flag) I decided to reinstall WIN 7 but oh wait couldn't just do an upgrade because that would actually be a &#34;downgrade&#34; so OS wouldn't allow it so getting ready to do a back up and clean install when the OS crashed every single time I started copying files to and external drive after the fifth time i gave up and just deleted this garbage off of my computer. To wrap things up be wary of compatibility between even the most popular hardware and software, even if Microsoft says otherwise because even if many review outlets are praising its greatness many people cannot even install it.	2015-08-12

My only negative comment is that its add-on for Outlook doesn't seem to play well with the program. Some emails cause Outlook to crash and the only thing that Microsoft has been able to tell me is that the add-on is the likely source of trouble. Of course, that could just be Microsoft trying to cover itself and your mileage may vary.	2015-08-12

Mostly I use it for distortion correction (converging parallels etc.) and touching up the exposure.  The burn/dodge tools are occasionally useful and were tools I used in the darkroom.  A nice new feature is AUTO SMART TONE which allows for a lot of control of the image simply.  I use Perfectly Clear plug in which is very similar and slightly more useful.  I had a real struggle getting Perfectly Clear to load in Elements 13 and eventually the people from that company had to do it for me.  Adobe should consider fixing this as something similar may occur with other plugins that people want to transfer from previous editions of elements.

It was worth the $50.00 fee to get my laptop working again.<br /><br />Thanks PC Matic.	2015-08-11

While there is a patch that must be loaded to access your database, there is a separate problem that will randomly stop some computers from accessing any data whatsoever.  I began the download at 10am, and encountered this bug.<br />After multiple calls to the help desk, and long intervals of transfers, I finally reached one help desk person who knew what the problem was (only because he too had encountered it when he loaded his own software.)  He told me that it was going to be a lengthy process to reinstall and also would need to rewrite some hidden system files on my computer.  He sent me the links but was not allowed to stay on the line while I did the updates.  After multiple tries, and several calls to the help desk, my computer was incapacitated for most of the day.  At 6pm, when my programmer husband came home from work, he took over, wrote some of his own code and got the program running.  (Glad that I have access to a computer geek at home!)  This was a nightmare.  The actual program, now that it is running is good, but it was a nightmare to get it installed.  That is a whole day of my life that I will never get back!!	2015-08-11

I checked drivers, I checked BIOS settings, I reflashed the BIOS to make sure it was up to date, I reinstalled about 5 times, the &#34;tech&#34; from Microsoft installed Win10 over the top of Win10.  No luck, no resolution to the problems I was having.  What a waste of money and time.  Now I have to rebuild my system almost from scratch and I am not a happy camper.

I've used Dragon naturally for about a decade now. On my main computer I've used Dragon 13 but found it had conflicts while I was working in the first tier reviewers for Windows 10. I knew it would be updated, eventually, and when I found that I needed a new convertible computer to take on the road with me I chose to buy this version because of its compatibility and price. So far, it is working really well with the new upgrade to Windows 10 on my Lenovo Flex 3.<br /><br />Because I didn't want to take my expensive wireless headset from the office I also bought a very reasonably priced headset that was approved for use with Dragon. I am in fact writing this review using the new headphone and my new copy of Dragon NaturallySpeaking Home 13.0. I'd say that response is quick, accuracy is fairly high for software barely a week old, and the combination of do headset and software has been a good choice.	2015-08-11

I am happy to see Amazon's unlimited storage offer (comparing to others) with very competitive pricing and no limit on photo size or type of files. I have over 6TB of photos (most in raw format) and videos created over the years and have been looking for online back-up solutions. I signed up the 3-month trial and subsequently decided to stay with it. Guess what, after 4 months, I am still unable to complete my first round of uploading. Why? The software sucks! Big time. It constantly gets stuck and requires attention, either pause and resume, or restart again. It becomes a daily chore. Don't tell me this is because of my internet connection. I have other sites (like smugmug, photoshelter, flicker, you name it), all you need to do is to drop the files and walk away. It may take hours but they will get the job done for you. Another example is to upload big video files to the video sites like Vimeo or YouTube, I can upload a multi-GB video file in one shot without any problem. While on Amazon, 90% chance is that you will get a spinning wheel and you have to try it again and again. Tech support is none existence.

I don't do a lot of video recording these days, but when I do, I want it to be quick to setup and simple to use, but still be able to provide good quality. My PC desperately needs some upgrades; so right now I can't record AA games with Fraps because I'm already struggling with performance and Shadowplay is even worse. Tested this out with Witcher 3 and no problems, woo!<br /><br />Recording video goes up to 2560x1980 resolution (which I haven't seen before), records at 60FPS (or whatever lower number you choose) and in .avi or .wmv. You can also turn off capturing the cursor, which is super nice. Microphone can be recorded in a second audio track, making it easier to clean up and apply later - not that anyone particularly wants to hear my charming Welsh accent.<br /><br />It also lets you save screenshots in any of the 4 formats (bmp, jpg, png, gif) which I like and I streamed for several hours to a friend direct to Twitch, which was way easier for me, as a very small-scale streamer than setting up xSplit, although I think overall there were less options/customisability - you can still use the overlay to add webcam direct through D3DGear.<br /><br />I've been using Fraps for around 5 years now, and whilst it is easy to use, the one major drawback (for me) is the absolutely massive file size. D3DGear records and compresses, thus making files a fraction of the size which makes storage much easier for me. If I had to describe it, I'd say it's an improved fraps meets a simplfied XSplit.<br /><br />There's a free 15 day trial on their website, so you don't have to take my word for it - if you're interested in recording or streaming you should definitely check it out.<br /><br />Note: I didn't purchase this through Amazon, but own and have tested it extensively through Steam.	2015-08-10

I enjoy a lot of the options on this product, such as the ability to move loops around and put effects on recorded audio (if you fish around in the effects menus), but there are a lot of issues that need to be worked on. For one thing, the loop engines they show in the demos on their website are NOT included in this program, or are a different version, which makes their tutorials a little confusing when you try to use the engines yourself. I've used the thing way more than I probably should, written MIDI stuff on it, and recorded voice, and most of the time it's pretty straightforward, but I've also had to remove it from my PC and redownload it 5 times now, and each time the VST components don't load the same way. I'm not sure why, and I haven't taken the time to fight with it or ask customer service about it, but it makes it difficult to keep using the program the way I want to, and frankly, I'm tired of trying. So yes. It gives you a good platform for manipulating sounds, but it isn't exactly reliable - which, if you read any of the other negative reviews, comes up a lot. You can't import or export .xhl music (written on a notation program like Finale, for example), either, which would be really handy for someone trying to go from notation to audio, or vice versa, but that's just me. I don't think I'll bother downloading this again for a sixth time. I'm moving on, people. Thanks for a learning experience.	2015-08-10

Wow, that certainly beats the old buy the DVDs for several hundred dollars, then pay again every year and a half or so for upgrades.  And speaking of upgrades, it is SOOO cool that new features are released every few weeks and we don't need to wait 18 months for an upgrade.  Having been an Adobe software user for over 20 years, I think this subscription program is wonderful.  It allows me to stay state-of-the-art with all the new features as soon as they are available, no more waiting 18 months for new toys that make my work (and life) easier.	2015-08-10

This is a great piece of software. I bought through Steam. I stream on twitch and used to use Open Broadcasting System (OBS) but it tends to eat too much bandwidth and cpu power while I stream. I like being able to stream without having the playback playing in the background. It just bugs me knowing that there is something useless going on in the back, taking up memory.<br /><br />This program is really easy to set up for twitch. Basically, just log-on into twitch through the program and set a hotkey. Press hotkey when ready to stream and press again to stop. Just fill in the blank.

It will continue to work just as it had in the past, but if you don't renew, you don't get access to new features.  (Duh, just like not upgrading from CS5 to CS6. . . .)<br /><br />When you do a dollar-for-dollar comparison, the subscription model makes great financial sense.  In the past, you paid full price for a program, then you paid a smaller fee every 18 months or so for upgrades.  Now you pay less over the long term and get new features every few weeks rather than every year-and-a-half.	2015-08-10

It used to be great and I have been using it since 2006.  This year, after I filed my 2014 tax returns, I realized I had forgotten to include an income item.  I logged into TurboTax and generated an Amended Return.  However, despite the fact that the program indicated that it would print only the forms required for filing, it printed every single tax form.  I sent numerous emails to TurboTax asking for help and received only canned responses that were not helpful.  I then tried deleting the Amended Return.  I followed the instructions provided by TurboTax and now my originally filed 2014 tax returns are incorrect AND I am unable to generated a new Amended Return.  I cannot even see the forms for previous tax years in the &#34;vault&#34; as TurboTax won't let me access the vault. I have sent yet another message to TurboTax but I am expecting to receive yet another canned, unhelpful response.  I will be researching other tax preparation software options for 2015.  Very disappointing since this used to be a great software.	2015-08-10

I reserved Windows 10 Pro for three computers (one laptop, two desktops)  that have been running Windows 7 Ultimate since it came out.  I have always been an AVID Microsoft and Windows fan.  I have vowed to never let my fingers touch a MAC.  I loved Windows XP, hated Vista as much as Apple, and most of all I really loved Windows 7.  I never bothered with Windows eight because it looked like it was primarily meant for Tablets and other touch screen devices.  However, after reading the reviews and an opportunity to try Windows 10 for free, I reserved the product for all three computers.  I was notified in two days that it was available for my laptop and I downloaded and installed the upgrade. It went well and I started to try it out.  Wow! I was really impressed and called several friends and family to tell them.  I was so excited about it, that I decided to not wait for the upgrade from the APP and went online to download the upgrade for one of my desktops from Microsoft manually.  MISTAKE Number 1.  After it was installed, I found I couldn't do certain things with it because it wasn't activated.  When I went to activate it, it sent me to the store and wanted $199 for a key. I decided no way was I paying for something I could get for free so I went to restore Windows 7.  I told the restore program to save my files which it would do, but then I got a message that all my APPS including MS Office would be deleted  and I would have to reload all of them.  Fortunately, all my computers have backup drives and before installing the upgrade, I had saved an image file of my old setup so that's what I did while I was waiting for MS to notify me that my program was ready for installation.  Later that day I went to edit a Word file on my Windows 10 laptop and when I tried to save it, I got a message that it was a read only file and I would have to save it under a different name.  I tried that and got another message that I was not authorized to edit files.  I got the same response in Excel and Access.  Of course you can't get any support from MS on the phone any more but I checked the forums and found others with the same problem. I was told I could edit the permissions section (fortunately I am the only one using this computer) so that anyone could have full access.  I did this and it solved that problem.  Then I found I lost the Start Menu and Cortana.  The Icons were still there, but the programs wouldn't come up.  You can no longer manually set up a restore point, but they had made a Critical Update and I was able to restore to that point.  Now I had Cortana and the Start Menu back, but I was getting read only files again.  I was going to try to reset the permissions again, but first I had to post some financial stuff on Quicken.  Lo and behold I got the same read only message on it.  That was the final straw.  I can't spend my life fighting a computer.  I already knew I was going to have to restore my old image file and that's what I did.  I still love Windows 7 and it looks like I'll be using it a long time.<br /><br />MICROSOFT, YOU LET ME DOWN!  My advice, if you decide to try it, be sure you have an external backup image or your life may be worse than mine.dit files.  I got the same response in Excel and Access.

Decided to register my protest by switching to H&R Block product and found it was actually the better product. I did not have any problem at all migrating all my prior data to the H&R Block software and it was actually easier to use. Filed return electronically without a hitch and everything worked as you would expect it too. Belatedly, the rival product reduced their price (but only for one year) but I decided I would rather deal with a more honest and upfront company like H&R Block.	2015-08-09

I tried windows 10 on my Surface Pro 3--three times. Each time I was happy for a few days and then discovered some problems and bugs that can't be fixed and that I cannot live with and decided that I have to roll back to win8.1. I do like the new system, and the idea of tablet and laptop mode, especially for a hybrid device, but at this stage it's simply too many bugs and I would suggest those on the fence that you wait for a while until everything is stabled. Here is a short list of pros and cons about win10:<br /><br />Pros: The UI is more sleek, and more desktop-friendly. Virtual desktop feature is nice. The message center with all menu options resembles that of an Android phone, which is pretty handy. Switch between tablet and desktop mode is also a good feature that lets you decide which world you want to be in. The start menu and Cortana search are especially handy if you get used to it.<br /><br />Cons: OneNote in windows 10 is HORRIBLE. It is no longer simple and straight-forward to use. The little rounded panel for stroke and color is gone. The UI is now completely the same as the desktop program, which is the same design as word, excel, etc. So the panel, plus the taskbar which you cannot hide, take up a lot of screen space. All I wanted is just a plain old college ruled notebook page in front of me, not so many settings that I never use. Also, OneNote crashes a lot more than in win8.1. Sync is slow. I am not sure if it's the server or win10 though.  Other than OneNote, there are also lots of bugs such as office or windows activation. Some other apps didn't work at the first place as well, such as the best known windows companion Drawboard PDF. After seeing two of my most heavily used apps struggle under win10, I say enough is enough, I am going back to win8.1.	2015-08-09

I have used Autocad software since the mid 1990's and I purchased Autocad LT 2015 some 6 months ago thru Amazon. I purchased the stand alone license with the dvd software.  I recently purchased a new Lenovo laptop and tried to load Autocad LT 1015 software onto it using a dvd drive.  I could not activate the software no matter how many times I sent emails to Autocad requesting a new activation code and uninstalling the software and re-installing it.  Since I am leaving on a business trip tomorrow and could not get any help from Autodesk on this installation problem and without my cadd software I lose $$$ per day, I had to spend another $1200 with Amazon to purchase yet another copy of Autocad 2015.  Believe me when I say if I could find another cadd software to use for my business I would buy it in a second.  I don not know how the support team at Autodesk can sleep at night know how they leave customers who pay so much money for their product in the lurch.  I would not recommend this company to my worst enemy.	2015-08-09

PROS  - all hardware is working well - Windows Apps now contained in desktop view. - Like the notification area and improved quick access to settings - like the clean look of the Windows 10 UI. - After all this time and thousands of upset users, they bring back the start menu - no crashes - start up time has improved with updates  CONS  - very difficult install when upgrading from Windows 7 (fix below) - Screen saver and auto monitor turn do not work at first (fix below) - no cloud sync for Edge bookmarks - no cloud sync for Start menu - If you are using WI-FI on desktop, you have to restart to enable a wired network connection - really would like the option to go back to Windows 7 start menu.  All they've done is taken the Windows 8 start menu and crammed it into a smaller space.  You could also navigate quicker through the Windows 7 start menu with just the keyboard. - You can only select the WIFI network through the smaller wifi icon.  The larger icon will only turn WIFI on and off. - I like the look of the Edge browser but the lack of cloud sync still makes Google Chrome the best. - If you use Office 2013 then what is the point of the Microsoft apps? - Microsoft needs to wake up and provide better support for Google products. - Outlook 2013 still does not sync rules you create - Any tags you create in One Note 2013 can't be viewed in online or mobile One Note - No skype app - One drive is unreliable and frequently has sign in errors on Android  Microsoft is just too far behind in the Mobile market.  And by the time they come out with universal apps, Google will have something bigger and better out.  Windows 10 looks better than previous versions but at the core it just feels average.  Basically, I feel like I’m mainly upgrading to get a nicer looking interface but no major feature improvements.  Now if you’re a huge Windows phone fan and are willing to wait 6 months to a year for universal apps and pray they aren’t crap, then you’ll get good value out ofthis upgrade.  But if you’re are Android user, then you might not get a great deal out of Windows 10.  I just can’t overlook the advantages and more features that Google products offer.  I’m also thinking of looking at the Chromebooks.  :)  Heck, if Adobe products worked on Chromebooks, then there would I see no reason for me to own a Windows PC.  FIXES ================================  So basically it took me about 4 to 5 tries and finally got help from someone.  Here are the steps that finally lead to a successful install: - - Windows update is set to NOT check for updates. - - Deleted the $Windows. BT and WS folder under C: - - also deleted from the downloads folder in windows/softwaredistribution - -  Deleted items in the datastore folder under software distribution - - ran windows update MANUALLY from the control panel - - came up with error ... searched for error on google and ran windows update checker - - ran windows update, that took awhile - - double checked all three folders and deleted new updates that showed up in the windows/softwaredistribution downloads folder - - clicked &#34;install windows 10&#34; and skipped the other updates  Hopefully that helps anyone that is having issues.  Seems like the problem is with the 4 folders that have temp files in them.  Not sure why this blocks the installation.  After install, I have problems where Cortana and the Start Menu wouldn't load.  I removed Avast, went with Windows Defender and Malwarebytes and that helped.  If your having the same problem, the recent updates might help as well.  So far IOBIT system suite works well with Windows 10.  Now the biggest problem I'm having is the computer will not automatically go into sleep and the screen saver is not working. UPDATE:  To fix this problem you have to disable the gaming joystick in the device manager.  UPDATE:  Installed the new November update and now have run into the BSOD and no way to get into safe mode and no roll back options work.  It looks like I'll have to do a HP reset to Windows 7.  So the only option was to reset back to Windows 7.  Most of my files are stored in the cloud and I'm happy to be back to Windows 7.     This is the worst experience with software I've ever had.  I'm now thinking I should pay closer attention to Apple computers.        I know its not recommended to install Windows in the early stages but at the same time, this is released as a final product that they are charging for.     They shouldn't be charging for this AT ALL and it should be put into beta version.    Microsoft is a joke when it comes to mobile and if they think that releasing unstable incomplete software is ok, then I'm concerned about their future.	2015-08-09

The older version of Quicken, once upon a time, looked like a ledger. The 2015 version is a dumbed down version that seems to have fewer features.  Although you can see what your annual spending looks like, the software doesn't allow for you to budget annually. You can only budget monthly. Intuit wants its users to buy into their online service where you have to pay by month to use it. One positive feature is that the program downloads from your online bank accounts really fast. Unless, you are willing to go to Quickbooks, you will not get the functionality of a robust personal accounting program. I am sorry I paid for this without knowing this fact and paid for Quicken. I will use Quickbooks software instead, but also fear that the company with dumb down the software in order to lure users to their monthly online service...	2015-08-09

I've been an Avast subscriber for about three years, including two paid subscriptions. If my use of this anti-virus, anti-malware program is an admission of liking, then this comment comes in the form of a complaint. The amount of advertising and pop-up interruptions Avast provides since it became the antivirus, anti-malware leader about four years ago has gone up. If the company that made this program listened to my comment, it should know that the reason for me picking it was because it ran in the background without interruption, except upon starting up my computer, to which it only said the few words, &#34;Avast virus database is now updated.&#34; And, those words were the only words I'd ever wanted to hear. Now that my credit card expired for my bank's replacement card, I am happy that the company cannot charge me automatically for the new paid subscription that I now refuse due to interruptions. I decided to take my business elsewhere. Thanks to Avast, but no thanks.	2015-08-09

I am not a professional photographer but I appreciate getting nice prints of my photos and this program has made a difference. I was using Corel Paintshop Pro 7 but I am not interested in creating layers or applying special effects to my photos so that's why I started using Lightroom. It takes a little time and practice to use the program but the results are worth it. I have used Tony Northrup's book and online videos to understand the program better and within a few weeks I have been able to really notice a difference in my photos. The lens correction features for the different camera profiles and lenses is great. But I think the best feature is that you won't end up with tons of duplicate photos after you have made adjustments. The ability to modify/adjust a photo without altering the original is brilliant and definitely saves on hard drive space. With all of my photo information being readily available I can review a shot and learn what I need to change in my settings the next time I go out shooting. Because of this I am getting better with learning my camera settings and requiring less adjustment to my photos. I think it is a great way to learn photography. It has enough settings though and there are certainly enough presets available on the internet if I want to totally change the mood of a photo. I'm definitely enjoying this program and learning some many ways to improve my photography.	2015-08-09

Here are a couple things I found very helpful:<br /><br />-Mobile : Quicken Deluxe 2015 allows you to use the mobile app for free.  You need a Quicken account and once that's established, your client version (Quicken on your personal computer) syncs your account(s) registration entries on the cloud (Quicken Cloud).  Your mobile device syncs to the cloud as well and allows you to track not just the money your spending, but where the transaction took place and the ability to take pictures of your receipt.  The resolution of the picture is fine.  Viewing it from your client requires you to download the picture if you want to zoom in and out.<br /><br />-One Step Update : This feature is extremely helpful for me because I'm way too busy to deal with my transactions manually.  Quicken has a One Step Update that allows me to download all my transactions automatically from my bank accounts, credit cards, loans and retirement account.  It was very easy to setup for me.  Sometimes I have to run the update a few times because something went wrong when trying to connect to the institution's server.  I experience that when I go directly to the institution's website, so I'm pretty sure it's not entirely Quicken's fault or even that it's their fault at all.  At the very least they give you an explanation of what happened.<br /><br />So why a four start and not a five star?  My bank actually charged me a fee for connecting Quicken to my bank.  It came in the form of an online fee.  I should have known better and this is not Quicken's fault at all either.  Would be nice if Quicken had the ability to flag banks that charge for the connection fee.  Maybe they do and I just don't know about it.  If someone can show me that they do, I'll will switch this review to a five star because I really like this app.	2015-08-09

The flaws this software exhibits are numerous. Frame rates slow to a crawl, the screen flickers in use, inconsistent timing for the countdown, inability to save external and internal audio as separate tracks, but by far, the absolute worst flaw, is that the software apparently hates getting closed! When quitting, Movavi takes control and appears to be rapidly clicking anything it can until it opens itself again! I've had to quit the software three to four times for it to give up! However, this behavior also means I need to quit everything else before quitting Movavi, because the first time this happened, my email was open, and it got into my spam folder and started clicking all of the links in each email! I'm not talking one or two here. Multiple links in about forty emails in about seven seconds! That time I did a hard shutdown of my computer but who knows what the links actually went to. On top of this I actually do need to shut down my computer after each use, because if I don't my entire computer continues to slow down afterwards. Not restart, shutdown! I will never, ever recommend this software to anyone! If I could give it negative stars I would without any hesitation.	2015-08-08

The upgrade listed all kinds of new features, doubt we'll use most.  And there's a big step back with this release.  Sadly, a major boo boo slipped past the product manager, development team, and test team.  None of the date functions, date displays, or date entry fields work correctly unless you set your Mac's date settings to Mac system defaults.  If you have customized your short format or long format, the new Quickbooks will not run right.  Period.	2015-08-08

You are not. I have been using Kaspersky for years, today i downloaded a program from what I thought was a safe place. But before I ran this program, I had Kaspersky check it first. Came back as clean, no virus etc, found.<br />Thought i was good to go.....turns out there was a virus, which Kaspersky found AFTER the program ran! It then went into crazy mode and said that it needed to disinfect the file, etc. gave the go ahead, and it ran for about twenty minutes and started coming up with notifications that this file and that file were no longer working etc. next thing I know, my computer is trashed......all from a program that Kaspersky said was clean.<br />So, what is the point of having an anti virus program, which I kept up to date, that does not let you know that is a problem until after you run the program....when I get this computer back to working, or if I have to get another computer, you can bet I will not be using Kaspersky!!	2015-08-08

If you install it from the e-mail that Amazon sends after purchase, it works fine. You have to create an account with Norton to use their products though. As it was setting up my account, a few messages came across my screen that didn't make sense &#34;Your trial subscription is now expired, click here to renew&#34;, but if you give it a second, it will all catch up and those messages go away without any action on your part. Eventually I got all green lights and was set up and ready. This really only took less than 5 minutes. There is one caveat that I was not happy about. Even though Norton says this product is compatible with Windows 10, it is NOT compatible with Microsoft Edge (replaced Internet Explorer). Norton will tell you that you must change your default browser in order to be protected while on the internet. Had I known this before buying, I would not have purchased this product as I like Microsoft's new browser and Windows 10. Never thought I had to confirm BOTH were compatible before purchasing.	2015-08-08

For all the great things Amazon does, this is a complete failure. Can you store a ton of photos for free with Prime? Sure you can, so that's good. Unfortunately that is the last 'good' I can come up with. Uploading photos is PAINFULLY SLOW. Viewing photos once they are uploaded is unusable. It's so darn slow, you'll give up after a few minutes of viewing your images.  You can upload raw files, but creating thumbs for them takes HUGE chunks of time. Go to a page filled with Raw files and you'll wait 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes before even 100 of them have preview thumbs. Try to even look at one of your raw images takes 3-5 minutes to load!!  That is insane!!!    So let's get this straight...a photo management system that in no way let's your organize or manage photos, is slow as a dog, doesn't let you view photos any other way other than by date (yes you can create folders to upload into, but inexplicably, the viewer can't show you them by folder!!), can't seem to detect the dates on a raw file (it does for JPG's only), takes 5 seconds to open a JPG that's LESS THAN A MEG!, can't display a RAW file even though it tries and fails with absolutely no error messaging or indication that there's a problem...just a black screen, and it let's you share photos via email with someone, yet you can't even view them if they are in raw format. Even an 18MP JPG file takes 10-20 seconds to load.  Amazon, at least give us an option to pay money for some extra speed and features. How about any ability to sort??  View individual folders of photos.  This is basic stuff guys!  Sure it's a throw-in to Prime to get unlimited photo storage, but once they are up there, unless you have every single file named with something meaningful, you can't even tell which photos are which!! Simply put, this is the worst photo system I've ever see, free or paid. My Google Drive seems to have absolutely no issues at all with a 25MB Raw photo file. Thumb iscreated almost instantly and I can open it up in a split second. Get a clue Amazon!	2015-08-08

If you haven't used any video-editing software before, then this will take a little getting used to.  It's simply nothing like a document, spreadsheet, webpage, and so on.  It took me about two hours of messing about to get the hang of it.  Once you do, it's very quick and easy to import and edit videos, add a soundtrack, titles, and so on.  I use a simple Sony Handycam to shoot HD video and a TASCAM DR-05 digital sound recorder to record the sound separately.  It's a simple task to line up the video sound waveform with the Tascam sound waveform, so synchronization is a snap.<br /><br />There are also a multitude of effects that I haven't needed to look at.<br /><br />If you just want to make a few youtube videos that look a bit polished, then this software is just right for you, and an amazing value to boot.	2015-08-08

It informed the people who had mysteriously also been connected to the link. I went in and tried to set a new calendar entry for the meeting. It said the right day and time. I clicked ok. It reverted to a meeting at 11:30 p.m. and automatically sent this info out to a bunch of people whom I had not invited. (I got a lot of WTF replies and looked very unprofessional). The interface makes the old Outlook seem like a graceful gazelle. Clunky, hard to navigate, old outlook folders mysteriously disappeared, nonfunctional features. I am a long-time apple user, and I have to say that the ethos of Microsoft has NEVER WAVERED. It is run by, designed by, serviced by a bunch of engineers and robots without a single awareness of how humans actually work on computers. Their software is ALWAYS unintuitive, awkward, ugly. But this? This is even worse than usual, as it has finally reached the level of unusable. And my workplace didn't give me a choice. I'm thinking of forwarding the entire mailbox to gmail. (By the way, I used to run a computer network for an entire newspaper, and have a high level of knowledge and experience. I'm an expert-level user and teacher of Quark (yay!), Indesign (ugh, so bad) and photoshop.)

I spent a couple of hours on the phone (45 minutes on hold) and ended up having to de-activate each account and then link it to a new account just to make it work.<br /><br />I also lost the running balances on my main checking account.

The install itself is pretty straight forward. and I have installed it on four computers, one each of Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Saw no real difference in the installs and it works well on all. I can not comment directly on whether as some have said it takes less resources and your computer in turn runs faster. Mine does, but I made other changes at about the same time. Due to this I can not say whether it was totally Norton. Like all Norton products, it goes about its business and protects your computer. I have it set up to automatically scan the computer which I never did before and it seems to work ... Read more	2015-08-07

I'd have to eliminate them. Not a big deal, but a royal pain in the ass after awhile. The chapter selection icons had to be lined up by eye, and the size of the lettering would change when I'd reopen the application. I used it just to do menus, in that I didn't care for Final Cut Pro's, and read a review that Elements was a good choice to use with it for menus. It also seemed to lighten up my video, and when I would darken it in Elements and then burn a dvd, it didn't seem to make any difference from one to the other. Didn't use it for the whole editing/production thing, so I have no opinion on that. I may try it, though, because FCP had its warts, too. I used a Pinnacle Liquid Edition 6 for nearly 10 yrs on a pc that, in my opinion, blows either one of them away.	2015-08-07

Things are laid out very poorly and make it very hard to start using the program. Once you get the hang of it, it's a little nicer. Maybe it's my fault for not spending a ton of time with it, but you'd think it'd be at least a little easier to use. Quicken also has quite a few quirks.. Such as not being able to categorize business income/expenses without a tax line. Not all of us want to go and buy TurboTax! Several times now I've had to reset my Quicken Cloud account to get it to sync with my phone. It just adds an obnoxious step to something that should be behind the scenes. Unlike the rest of the program, I can give Intuit credit for the app. Once you're done with the adventure of trying to get it to sync properly, the app is nice. It actually provides more reports than the desktop app, and is much less buggy. Overall, is it worth it? I can't really say.	2015-08-07

I had to buy this after updating my computers to Windows 10. I had been using Microsoft Money 2006, but Windows 10 doesn't run it. Unfortunately, Money 2006 was too old to be able to convert my data to a usable Quicken import file, so I has to put in all of my accounts manually.<br /><br />Like most programs that you use for the first time, there was a bit of a learning curve. I don't think it is as pretty or as easy to use as my old Microsoft Money 2006, but after a few days of trial and error, I've figured out the little quirks and have become pretty comfortable using it.<br /><br />You do have to create a Quicken (Intuit) account log in when you first run it or log in to your existing Intuit account. I don't use online services or link to a phone or tablet app, so I can't say anything about how well it syncs with them. I'm strictly an offline user and enter all of my info manually. It asks during the initial set up how you want to enter data, so I just picked manual.<br /><br />I'd still rather be using Microsoft Money, if I had a choice, but so far I am satisfied with this program.	2015-08-07

H&R Block's tax software did just this very easily and without a steep learning curve for a new user like me.  The Schedule K1 input could have been a little easier/cleaner as it required more specific input that the Turbo Tax software that I used previously did, but it was manageable and the final result was correct.

Purchased this to install on several of my new work computers which have a different McAfee program on purchase, but term had expired.  Program would not install, even after I uninstalled the prior version of McAfee.  Customer support was able to install for me, but it took a good hour for just 1 computer.  now trying to install on a second laptop and same problem again.  Looking back I've had issues installing McAfee software on other computers in the past, and I had switched to Kaspersky - was a breeze to install.  Should have done Kaspersky again, but the price was good and I thought things would be better now.  I'm a fool for thinking that way.  Not willing to spend another hour with customer support, so I'm going to go back to Kaspersky or some other competitor.  Hopefully I can get my money back.	2015-08-06

I am an avid Amazon enthusiast and evangelists, but Amazon Cloud is one big disappointment. It seems every other cloud service has figured out the basics of delivering an accessible and intuitive UI, while AC is stuck in the 90's.

I have chosen to use Kaspersky for years.  I installed Kaspersky Internet Security (KIS) 2015 shortly before installing the new Windows version 10.  When I updated Windows, KIS displayed a message saying it protects you in the Windows 10 operating system.  Later I tried the KIS Safe Money feature that isolates your browser when you are at financial web sites.  I was disappointed to find that it did not activate in the Windows 10 browser, Microsoft Edge.  I discovered that Safe Money still works in my old Internet Explorer browser.  From a web site in Edge, it's easy to switch to the same site in the old browser, just two clicks.  KIS customer service told me they are working on an update.	2015-08-06

After 3+ months of trying to resolve an issue with Amazon's cloud service, I see they are now promoting yet another desktop app to save all your precious pics using their cloud service.  BEWARE.  I'm a big fan of Amazon, and maybe I'm an outlier on the continuum of customer satisfaction, but this spring, they LOST ALL MY PICTURES and could not recover them.  I won't say don't use them, but I'd never use them exclusively for file back ups, regardless of what you want to save.  Physical drives, alternative cloud service, whatever, I'd think about redundancy beyond Amazon cloud service for whatever you want or need to save/archive.  BTW, they deleted a treasure trove of photos taken on our trip to Europe.  They were taken with my SLR, downloaded to iPad while traveling for daily FB updates, and subsequently uploaded to Amazon cloud (via Amazon Photo App).  I assumed they were safe in the cloud, so deleted them off my iPad after they were uploaded.  Mistake.<br /><br />In short, be careful if your digital content matters to you.	2015-08-06

I read the reviews here and thought I might offer a bit of balance. I transcode video from my digital cameras all the time... and over the years, as I've changed cameras, I've had several different video formats. The one that was the biggest problem was an old Kodak I owned in 2004. It shot video but at 12.9 frames per second... and I could not both merge these small files, resize, AND up the framerate to 25 or 30 fps. This program lets me do this.<br /><br />I only use h264 to encode... so I can't speak for any of the other codecs... and this program does have all the advanced settings... but it documentation is terrible and unlike some very capable free programs I've used like AVI4PSP, AVIDEMUX, and Handbrake... you can't run a cursor over a setting and get some guidance to learn what it does and many of these settings give you no preset values to choose from. That's just crazy.<br /><br />As for the person who got worst results than what they put in... I can only guess they don't know what their doing... and picked a bitrate way too low for good results. It's always best to do at least a 2pass encode with a adequate bitrate for the format. So for standard 640x480 30fps I use 1800-2000kbs. That's still way lower than the 9000kbs my camera shoots at.. but then it uses an very inefficient format.<br /><br />That being said... it's not worth $49. It doesn't even give that as the regular price at their site. There it's $29.	2015-08-06

I thought no way letting them & download something more in my computer.  Hung up & thought will download myself & delete the old McAfee subscription.  Did so, but since I had used the code I bought, wouldn't let me use it again.  Amazon was kind enough to give me another code.  LOVE Amazon.  When downloaded McAfee from site online, used my same email & password from prior subscription & kept saying was expired still.  Called McAfee & someone guided me how to get the new installed.  They said had to download Internet Exployer, which I thought I already had on my computer.  She gave me the web address to type in & told her, I want my default the same & don't want her changing anything on my computer.  She said, OH NO, but oh yes.  Now my default is Yahoo & can't get rid of it.  I called McAfee & said only way could fix the issued is to let them into my computer.  No Way.  Will never get McAfee again.

I recently had a blip with the software and it wouldn't start on my macbook but the cook'n support team resolved the problem quickly and professionally.  I would highly recommend this product.	2015-08-06

Can't even see fit to give this software even (1) star. What would be the point in having financial software that you can't download account info, then import it into an individual account. i.e. download your checking account info from your bank (mine all use .QIF) select import and get &#34;We're so sorry&#34; but you can't import that info into your checking acct. in Quicken.<br />Then there is the real cute one, in order to import MS Money files into Quicken you have to have MS Money installed on your computer. Who in their right mind would downgrade to Quicken if you have a functioning copy of MS Money on your system.<br />Thought I lost my MS Money forever, due to upgrade to Win10, fortunately I found a registry change that brought MS Money back to life. Bye Bye Quicken.	2015-08-06

With Apertures departure I was forced to move to another Photo editing and management tool.  I tried several and ended up with this as it had the best features and fit easiest into my workflow.  It is a little slow at start up with a library of about 12,000 pics on a quad core 2.6 Ghz i7 Mac.  But it works well.  The main thing I like is that it can work with your photos in your folder structure, rather than having to make a copy.	2015-08-06

This is the third cookbook product I have used in the past 10 years. This product has been far soupier to other products I have used. it does everything I need to do with my personal recipes. The ability to capture recipes from a WEB site is great. with some of the other products I used you had to download the recipe from the WEB and then cut and paste it into the cookbook product.  The support for the product is also great. I just updated to Windows 10 and had a problem with Cook'n starting. I sent the problem off to the support team along with the log file and support was able to resolve this issue in less than 24 hours. Cook'n is running under Windows 10 fine at this time.  I recently had a problem with my old computer and I lose all of my applications. I contacted DVO support with my issue and they sent me a link to re-download the product for my new machine. They also assisted me in getting my install back up and running.      I would recommend this product to anyone that wants a great cookbook product to store and manage their recipes.	2015-08-06

Norton 360 was a piece of junk, but still provided virus protection in spite of being an absolute CPU hog.  I've been using Norton Internet Security the past few years in spite of it not giving me as much control as I'd like.  But none of them were as bad as this version of Norton Security.  It nagged me EVERY DAY because I chose not to install its toolbar in Chrome - in spite of checking the option (every day!) to never remind me again.  I finally gave in and installed it.  Then I promptly disabled it because I just don't like 3rd party toolbars in my browsers.  Guess what?  Now the stupid software is nagging me again because the toolbar is disabled!  Argggggghhhhhhh!!!  Enough already!  Norton Security has become the MALWARE that it's supposed to protect me against!<br /><br />Unless this major bug gets fixed soon, I will NOT be purchasing another Norton product.  There are many other virus protection programs out there (including free ones) that will protect me without the constant nag screens.  Norton has lost its focus on this product and forgets what its software is supposed to do.  It's time to leave it behind.	2015-08-06

They are supposed to sell it to some other vendor. I've never seen a software sale of this magnitude work. For that reason alone this would be a two star rather than three star purchase.<br /><br />What takes it down to 1 star is that today I'm getting Quicken emails about spending patterns. I did not (knowingly) enable online access to my accounts.<br /><br />Don't use this product.<br /><br />--------<br />The market for personal finance software is not what it was 15 years ago. It is now a niche market. (The reason why that happened is beyond the scope of an Amazon review.)<br /><br />I am sure nobody would develop Quicken for Windows (the gold standard) today. It's development was funded in a different era, including the painful process of establishing connections to banks. So we can't compare a new product (Quicken for Mac 2015) to that product. If you want all those features you need to run windows in a Mac VM or do dual boot.<br /><br />So we compare this product to using a spreadsheet (ugh) or iBank 5. Unfortunately that's a very hard comparison to make. I mentioned this was a niche market -- I've not seen any serious head-to-head comparisons from a trusted source.<br /><br />I opted for this product assuming it leveraged the bank connectivity network funded by Quicken for Windows. It does indeed do that.<br /><br />It is not a stellar product. It desperately, desperately, needs a manual -- but the finance market is now so small that even niche ePublishers won't write a guide for it. Installation and configuration was quirky. Manual setup of 529 and other non-integrated investment tools is weird. I ran into several UI bugs and usability issues.<br /><br />There's no Help file.<br /><br />On the other hand, after initial setup it's bringing data in from a variety of investment sources and multiple US bank accounts. That's something.<br /><br />I think it's worth the money. A manual might even make it four stars.	2015-08-05

Do Not Upgrade.  MS says the horible look "is by Design"	Horrible, horrible interface!  Unless you like light gray on lighter gray and white.  Microsoft says it is a design choice (MS' choice, not the customer)<br /><br />Buy a previous version of VISIO and MS Office if you can.  DO NOT UPGRADE to Visio 2013 - You WILL be sorry.<br /><br />I upgraded from VISIO 2010 at our company.  Tried using it for about an hour.  I am a power user of the graphics portion of VISO with highly customized Ribbon and quick task bar.  While the customizations were recognized by VISO 2013 after the upgrade, the customizations and icons were almost unrecognizable and unreadable!  Windows 8 and 10 vomit bright and garish primary colors all over the screen.  Yet the new 2013 interface is a sea of gray and white.  There is very little color (other than shades of gray) and no depth to the icons or buttons. Only three schemes are available.  Light Gray, Gray, and Dark Gray (I am not kidding, those are the only options)  The dark gray is not close to having sufficient contrast.  I have been using VISIO since 1998 or 1999 and every version up to and including 2007 was an improvement.  VISIO 2010 and its ribbon (and removal of functionality) was a downgrade from VISIO 2007.  In contrast with VISIO 2013, VISIO 2010 is a vastly superior version.(2013 is an extreme DOWNGRADE from 2010)<br /><br />When I went looking for additional skins or themes, every forum overwhelmingly had complaints about this ugly and unreadable theme (and no, you cannot change it).  On the Microsoft site, there were also a huge number of complaints.  Microsoft's answer was &#34;The Theme is this way by design&#34;<br /><br />Microsoft, still appears to have failed to learned by the recent debacles of the XBONE (MS had to back off of several early stances and design choices which have greatly reduced sales numbers ) and Windows 8 (Vast numbers told MS they hated the interface long before it was released)Instead of telling customers the software look is &#34;By Design&#34; MS should paying more attention to what customers are saying (and fire the art school dropout's who came up with this mess of a user interface without decent choice of themes).<br /><br />I had the IT department uninstall 2013 and reinstall VISO 2010.  I simply could not comfortably use VISIO 2013.<br /><br />We have a home use program at work that allows us to purchase and use Office 2013 and Visio 2013 at home for a very small cost.  Even at nearly free, I refuse to purchase and use a product that is a vast and flat wasteland of white and gray.<br /><br />It may be a Microsoft design choice.  MY CHOICE as a customer is NOT TO BUY for home or USE Office 2013 or Visio 2013 at the office.	2015-08-05

(I have been using Cook’n since version 8 which I bought in 2011).  Something went wrong during the conversion and as a result I could not open Version 11.  I contacted the DVO support group and they have been very prompt in their replies and suggestions.  I still had versions 9 and 10 on my computer at the time I installed Version 11.  My problems have all been worked out now and because I had previously exported my various cookbooks I was able to import them into Version 11 with a new install. I didn’t lose much at all just a few new recipes in my personal cookbook that can be put back in.  Last night I started playing with Version 11 and I am absolutely thrilled with it.  I thought Version 10 was good but Version 11 totally blows it away.  Using the new Snip-It Import Tool I have been able to get recipes I had saved in Evernote into Cook’n and using my scanner I was able to add back the printed copies I had of the few that I lost during the initial install.  Tonight I pulled out some old recipes my Mom had clipped out of various newspapers.  Some are dated 1986 and 1987 and the pages have somewhat yellowed with age.  I scanned these into my computer and then used the Snip-It tool and was able to get the recipes into Cook’n with just minor cleanup where creases or age of the paper interfered slightly with the OCR software.  It beats the heck out of typing all this stuff in.  There are three ways to use Snip-It; using a scanner, clipping from a web page or using clipboard.  I have used all three methods.  I LOVE VERSION 11.  (The Capture tool is also still in Version 11) This is in my opinion the best Cook Book software out there and besides being so convenient this new version is so MUCH FUN. I have used Google image search to find pictures for some of the recipes that I originally printed but that when scanned didn't bring in the picture.  Like I said earlier in this review, I have used4 versions now and whenever I have had a problem the DVO support team has done their best to help me sort it out.  I am very happy with the support from the DVO team and with the new Version 11.  I rate the software and support 5 out of 5 STARS.  Nina Irwin  UPDATE: ; ;8/26/2015 I have had a problem syncing new recipes from my PC to the Cook'n Cloud.  Technical Team has deleted my Cloud Account 5 or 6 times now and I have had to delete &#34;Workspace&#34; and then restore my backup, then re-create my Cloud Account and then I can sync one time from PC to the new setup Cloud Account.  After that, if I am very lucky I am able to sync changes one time from the PC to the Cloud before getting the &#34;something unexpected happened and expected data cannot be found...&#34; message pops up and I am unable to sync.  Everything else in the program works fine but I wanted to be able to sync recipes to my Kindle so I could use the Kindle in the kitchen instead of printing every recipe.  Unfortunately I was only able to accomplish this one time.  It's not on the Kindle side it's a problem syncing from my PC to my Cloud Account.  I have been unable to sync now since 8/22/2015 and have not had a reply from DVO on the latest problem.  I still love the overall Cook'n but am very frustrated with the inability to Sync to the cloud.  So I have had to drop my stars from 5 to 4.	2015-08-05

I enjoy the different cookbooks I've downloaded and being able to get internet recipes added to program. I love having my own cookbook to add my own recipes and be able to easily email them to friends. It's nice too having the nutrition information available. I love having the app on my ipad/iphone so that I don't have to print out the recipe from my PC and take it to the kitchen or grocery store. The mobile apps sync with the PC so I'm always up to date. ON occasion when there is a problem with some part not working as usual, DVO support works to solve the issue. Recently when my Cookn on the PC would not email a recipe, I sent an email requesting help. After trying to explain what my settings were, the Technician suggested that I make a picture of that screen and send it to her. Issue was solved right away! I also enjoy the Newsletter!	2015-08-05

Try it you will like it!, August 5, 2015	Love this software and software support. They are constantly upgrading and adding new features. I have had this software since version 8, now on 11. I have been a collector of recipes and cookbooks for years and this software lets me create my own favorite cookbook, and create family cookbooks, add photos and themes to the cookbooks. The nutritional, shopping lists, and menu plans are awesome. They also release new cookbooks monthly so it is great to be able add these also. The newsletter is great and features videos (did I say you can add videos too).<br />Probably one of the greatest things is if you are looking for a recipe on the web you can add it to your cookn from the web with a click of the button. I have the pc version, but they also mobile/android versions and synching to a cloud service so you can't loose your recipes. Can't say enough nice things about this company and product and service, extremely satisfied!!!!	2015-08-05

It is simple and easy to use with a clean interface.  It loads very quickly, you can type anything you want for each entry and the calculator lets you balance each check register at your leisure. I use it to track 9 different accounts.  In the version that I have you can track up to 10 accounts. In addition to using it as check register, I also use it to reconcile my credit card purchases, as well as for other finances.  I now find this simple and easy to use product to be indispensable, and the customer service support is absolutely fantastic.  I recently bought a new computer and although I easily copied the software from the old computer to the new one, I couldn`t figure out how to transfer the many years of historical entries in the check registers to the new computer.  A customer service representative walked me through it, step by step.  The customer service representative was super responsive, extremely courteous, highly knowledgeable and very, very patient.  I rate this 5 stars overall, although I only give the software 4 stars because in the version that I have you cannot copy and paste, but the developers get and extra star for outstanding customer support.  I am most definitely a fan.	2015-08-04

HourGuard is reasonably priced and you don't have to buy it every year. I have been using it for several years and I believe I had to buy a newer version when I got Windows 7, but I now have Windows 10 and I haven't had to update. I need to account for my time while working for each client and this is a simple, user friendly, program that does just that. It works my time out to the minute - and since I don't do math - it does that for me as well. I can also invoice for whatever time period I choose.<br />1 Drawback - save the original downloaded installer because if your computer crashes a couple of years later, you will need it. It happened to me and I went to the site and downloaded the program again, but it said my password info didn't work with this newer version. I had to find the most recent installer that I saved when I initially bought it. I did try other time tracking software, but I wont waste my time trying others again.<br />Also, I didn't pay for extra support, but when I did have a question, they ALWAYS got back to me within a couple of days.<br />-----  I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  -----<br />p.s. I also own others programs by NCH and I would give all of them a 5 star rating.	2015-08-04

I have been an Intuit victim/user for many years now.<br /><br />It took an hour with my bank (B of A) to figure out that downloading transactions suddenly not working any more with Quicken Home & Business 2012 was Intuit's problem -- the visible error messages were useless, but if you accidentally hovered your cursor over one of them, you got the real error message that &#34;YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED: UPDATING YOUR BANKING TRANSACTIONS WILL NO LONGER WORK. YOU MUST GET OUT YOUR WALLET AND UPGRADE TO 2015&#34;. Wow. I don't recall being warned, but OK.<br /><br />So I upgraded -- silly me. Persistently 2015 wouldn't install at all, or I continued to get the message &#34;you must upgrade to 2015&#34; even though I was running 2015. This after almost 2 hours with tech support at Intuit. They said &#34;installs with all software frequently have problems.&#34; Really? Not my experience with 90% of the rest of software-land. With REAL software companies, that is.<br /><br />For my purposes it is sufficient to download a CSV of my banking transactions and categorize them. That's my plan going forward -- considerably less hassle than trying to make their software work (again and again and again).	2015-08-04

Many times when upgrading to a new version of Windows the Windows Upgrade will fail and the only way to do an upgrade of Windows is with a clean install...The problem is with a clean install you are left with your new operating system but none of your old Applications or files will be available. PCMover Professional (Latest Version for Windows 10) will help you transfer all those applications and files on your old PC to your new PC (Or on your upgraded PC). There are at least 3 methods to doing this...Either an in place upgrade from your Windows.old folder from your upgraded PC. A PC to PC transfer method via USB or Crossover ethernet (or network) and lastly via an external hard drive. To accomplish this you run the PCMover software on both your OLD and NEW computers following the instructions. It will then begin the process depending on which method you have chosen. At the end you will have your files and Applications on your new computer. I have used PCMover to migrate applications and files from XP to Vista, Vista to Windows 7 and now from WIndows 7 to Windows 10 (Because Windows 10 would not migrate my applications on at least one of my computers). If you are like me and have a LOT of applications installed PCMover Professional will literally save you a week's time of installing all your applications and files over again. It is well worth the price. Sometimes some applications cannot be moved or do not move properly but I would say 80 to 90 percent get moved and are working after the process and the rest you can do yourself. Highly recommended.	2015-08-04

The upgrade install crapped out on my daughter's laptop before it even got started. It said something needs my attention, click that, and it reboots, only to say something needs my attention (but not what) again. On my gaming PC it stalled at 32% installed, forcing me to hit the reset button. Luckily it was able to revert to Windows 7 and the computer works fine.<br /><br />Those failures to install were the BEST experiences I had with the Windows 10 upgrade.<br /><br />On my living room computer Windows 10 installed perfectly (well, after having to delete all the installation files it had downloaded and forcing the update again from the command prompt due to multiple update failures). And that's where the trouble began. It looked like everything was going well, then I discovered I had no sound at all. Keep in mind this is the computer that I use for multimedia in the living room, connected to my big screen and surround sound. Without sound, it's pointless. I updated my sound card driver to the latest version (even though Windows 10 compatibility isn't expected until October) and got sound back! Yay!<br /><br />Then the internet conked out completely. The network was fine. I was even able to stream a movie from this computer to my gaming computer downstairs with no trouble, and every other PC and device in the house could get to the internet without a hitch, but Win10 kept saying that there was a problem with the broadband modem's ability to connect to the ISP. I tried some Microsoft fixes via their support forums (even getting it to say there was an internet connection - for about 15 seconds) and finally gave up. I decided to revert back to Win7.<br /><br />I started Windows 10's built-in rollback feature and the computer went into an endless reboot-&#34;Restoring Previous Version Of Windows&#34;-reboot cycle. After about three hours and countless reboots I figured out it wasn't working. I ended up having to reinstall Win7 from scratch - losing all settings and installed programs (unfortunately I'm also lazy and careless and have lost some activation codes and keys - including for MS Office 2013 - which means unless I can find them eventually, I'm going to have to buy them all over again). If I had planned on installing Win7 fresh I could have used a keygrabber and retrieved some of those keys and activation codes prior to reinstalling.<br /><br />Thanks to the Windows 10 upgrade I'm not only back to Windows 7, but I'm WORSE OFF than I was before.<br /><br />I also upgraded my mom's PC and now her printer doesn't work. This is not because the drivers aren't working - Win10 reports the printer is installed and working fine. No, the Windows Print Spooler service is broken and I can find no fix for it online. Also, the Windows 10-compatible version of Kaspersky won't run anything but Safe Mode on her PC. It says a reboot is required to fix the problem. So you reboot. Then it fails again and says - yep, you guessed it - a reboot is required to fix the problem.<br /><br />And I just got word from my stepson that he had to reintsall Windows 7 from scratch after Win10 broke his PC, too. I don't have the details, but at this point do you need any more to convince you to stay away until MS gets it right?<br /><br />Early adopter, beware. [smh]	2015-08-04

I have been a Quicken user and supporter since 2010 and have loved the software.  Recently I have been using my MAC more and more and decided to move from Quicken for Windows to Quicken for MAC.  This has by far been the biggest disappointment in a software product I have ever encountered.  For starters, I had to go through a convoluted conversion process that required additional downloads to convert, didnt work on Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, I had to download on another windows 8 machine just to do the conversion.  Once converted and moved to the MAC, The interface is not the same I have come to respect.  The calendar views do not show all data as they did before, new transactions are not calculated in the Calendar view, but are in the Billing reminders.  I get different information yet from the reports.  It is completely unusable and unreliable as a home financial package.  Save yourself the headache.  I will be running a VM on my MAC with windows just so I can go back to using Quicken for Windows.	2015-08-04

I called G Data service and received instructions of how to fix this problem. The instructions seemed quite complicated but I was eventually able to fix it. Then a few weeks into 2015, this same problem appeared. The announced update could not be performed. I've got tired of this seemingly endless flaw, so have a security system that offers no security.

(Updated, September 28, 2015)<br /><br />I am a long-time user of Microsoft Office. In fact, I have owned versions of Office since Windows 95 debuted twenty years ago.<br /><br />Late last year, I decided to purchase a subscription to Office 365. I opted for &#34;Office 365 Personal&#34; because it was the least expensive way for me to get the software I wanted with all of the features I needed.<br /><br />At the time I subscribed, &#34;Office 365 Personal&#34; came with the 2013 versions of Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, and Word. On September 22, 2015, Microsoft released the 2016 versions of all its Office programs; I have recently updated to these latest versions. I use Excel and Word almost every day, PowerPoint infrequently, and OneNote almost never. I found the 2013 versions just different enough in appearance and functionality from my &#34;Office 2007 Home and School&#34; suite that they created a bit of a &#34;learning curve&#34; for me. It didn't take me long to adjust to the changes in the newer versions, but I discovered that I liked the 2007 version just a little bit better - enough so that I eventually gravitated back to using my tried-and-true &#34;Office 2007&#34; programs almost exclusively. Now I plan to give the 2016 versions a good workout to see if they are the ones that best suit my needs on a daily basis. My initial impression of the new versions is pretty positive.<br /><br />I kept my &#34;Office 365 Personal&#34; subscription active, however, and I'm very glad I did. Earlier this year, Microsoft released &#34;free&#34; versions of &#34;Office 365&#34; for Android devices. There was a catch to this release though: Android versions of Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and OneNote provided only limited (what Microsoft euphemistically calls &#34;core&#34;) functionality... that is, unless users happened to have an active subscription to any one of the &#34;Office 365&#34; versions. Users {like me) who do have a subscription have all of the &#34;Office 365&#34; features at their fingertips.<br /><br />Is &#34;Office 365 Personal&#34; worth the money spent on a subscription? If you already own any previous version of Microsoft Office, and use it only on a PC, probably not. However, the program's value rises sharply if you want to use it on any kind of Android-based mobile device. Then a subscription becomes essential and worthwhile in order to take full advantage of everything &#34;Office 365&#34; has to offer. Recommended.34; features at their fingertips.<br /><br />Is &#34;Office 365 Personal&#34; worth the money spent on a subscription?

We got the new software automatically because we had to purchase a new computer when our our hard drive died.  We use our computer only for a few programs and are novices when it comes to new uses.

I gave this one start because 0 stars in not an option.  This product is comes bundled with software.  I downloaded it to a fresh Windows installation.  The operating system was hours hold, clean with Norton AV installed. I had planned to use it to plan out a basement remodel.  After playing with it for a few mins I closed out of it.  The program immediately sent up pop up telling me that it could clean my system or optimize it. (It has been a few days, I forget the exact message.)  The pop up was branded with the same name as this software.<br /><br />It seems the this business model here is to get you to download this free software just try to get you to pay for something else.  At a minimum this is annoying, at worst it is malware.  Since it didn't want it on my system and wasn't aware that the software publishers had bundled it in with the software I was wanting, I classify it as malware.  This is deceptive business practice and I'm surprised Amazon would be party to distributing it.  Amazon generally has a good brand, it seems a bit tarnishing to associate with this kind of business practice.	2015-08-03

Since I already pay for these movies, either by renting them online or by paying for video streaming, I have the right (called right of use) to copy these movies to disc for my own personal collection.  Since copy protection was put in place it has been a real challenge to find a way to copy movies to disc since all disc recorders are now programmed not to write movies to disc if they are copy protected.  I've tried using devices that strip the copy protection out (like Grex Dimax).  The problem with that is the best quality I could get was 480i since I had to use S Video cables to do this.  In addition, regardless of what the sellers of these types of devices say, it does degrade the quality of the picture and you can really see it on a 52&#34; HD TV.  Then I found Audials Moviebox. I downloaded the trial version which is extremely limited in functionality, but there's enough functionality to validate whether the product really works.  Although the trial version says that it will record for only 10 minutes, my experience was that it would record for only 2 minutes.  But that was enough to create a video and play it on my blu ray player and look at it on my 52&#34; HD TV.  OMG, the quality is incredible.  It records in 720p (and there are levels of quality you can select based on size (the number of GB), but when I play it on an upconverter (like a blu ray player), it looks like 1080i.  I AM THRILLED.  The only drawback is: I think the help documentation within the software could be better and the software is not intuitive. I'm in technology and design applications and our philosophy is that a user should be able to use an application without any help at all.  Moviebox is far from that, but after a couple of hours I got it, and once you get it, it's a piece of cake.  Copying a 3 or 4 hour movie would be a challenge if using RW discs since they have capacity for only 4.7 GB.  But in that case I think I would make it a 2 disc movie, so there is a workaround.  You stream the movie on your computer and hit record in Moviebox, so you must have a computer that has enough memory and processor speed to handle this software otherwise it will hang. The specs are on the Audials web site.  I would highly recommend this software.	2015-08-03

Just upgraded and bought an MSI nightblade gaming PC with Windows 10 and also used usb flash to upgrade my laptop.  So far Windows 10 works great.  I never really had that many issues with windows 8 but it did make me want to try Mac os which I did for a while.  After becoming tired with my limitations of the macOS platform I switched back to Windows 10 and bought a new PC.  Thus far the Windows 10 OS is performing excellent and even my older game and programs work great and if they run into an issue Windows 10 runs the troubleshoot window and gets it working quickly which is awesome.  I transferred all my music from my Mac to Windows 10 seamlessly which is a huge plus when changing operating systems.  The system boots up and is fully ready to use within seconds.  The latest build of the edge browser is great, fast and with the addition of add ons it's my new favorite browser.  Very pleased.  My laptop upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 was also easy and worked right the first time, the laptop now actually runs better which was nice.  I was skeptical when I read about the privacy issues, but you can configure what data is collected and the stuff that is collected is the same data Mac OS or any other system logs.  Very nice job Microsoft, great new operating system.u somewhere else, do you understand why it's free...more like freemium.<br /><br />The new edge browser simply sucks compared to any other browsers out there including internet explorer. When you launch edge it gives you an infinite scrolling screen of MSN news and ads that you cannot turn off, at least I cannot find a way to do it, with a search bar saying &#34;where to next&#34; where you can do a web search with bing. I wanted to change my web search to Yahoo but it required going to yahoo.com then opening then new edge menu bar, and adding it then setting it to default, users on windows 7/8 will have trouble with this as it can be very tricky to find. I didn't find many positives with edge, it loads up decently but what’s the use when you have an a fraction of the options and customizations you have with any other browser and the fact that Edge doesn’t support a lot of websites hence why Windows 10 still has Internet Explorer tucked away. I can draw on the web page I’m looking at....whoopee, it's the app version of internet explorer on Windows 8 with Microsoft paint integration.<br /><br />The OS feels more like a phone than ever before.  If you boot up windows 8.1 then took a windows phone and laid it on the bottom left corner of the pc monitor screen you have Windows 10. It almost runs like an advertising tool for Microsoft to sell you useless crap via tiles and notifications popping up. I tried playing my games that I was running fine on Windows 8.1/7 and there are many issues and graphics issues. Some games like Borderlands/Borderlands 2 have major graphic issues now where bushes and bullets look like paint blotches splattered on the screen no matter how much you play with the video options. Dead Island, Left 4 Dead 2 and Dying Light will not work at all, they simply crash when launched so I’m wondering if my ATI Radeon card is having windows 10 update issues as they worked on 8.1.  WOW just stopped working as well, battle.net app freezes and looses track ofwhere the files are stored on my PC, but now works fine since I deleted this Microsoft spyware off my PC and went back to 8.1.<br /><br />Windows 10 update will override the drivers installed by your graphics card suite causing crashes, graphical problems and infinite restarts if the driver you have installed is not the one big brother has in their auto update. Again I had hopes that Microsoft would actually deliver a quality product like Windows 7 but instead we get a lazy freemium version of windows 8.1 that rivals google it terms of disgusting spying/data stealing for profit. Windows 10 is &#34;freemium&#34; not free, you pay for it by giving up every ounce of privacy for Microsoft’s financial benefit.  They baseically turn your PC into a Microsoft server, your PC can also be used to upload updates to other pc users/owners like a hotspot.<br /><br />I’m glad that I switched to OSX again a few months back and only use windows on my secondary computer, I won’t be putting this garbage on my mac. If you do upgrade the first thing you should do is go into every settings menu you can find and check the privacy options, you will still be data mined just not as badly. You will have to do this more than once as there are for example two control panels....named the same but both with their own privacy settings.  The split personality of Windows 8 is back in full effect . In short Windows 10 is just Windows 8.1 freemium edition, you even still have to right click the start menu to get control panel (one of them) and stuff quickly because if you traditionally left click on it, it wil just shows you apps and useless tile garbage, basically the Windows 8 start screen in a box instead of desktop features and shortcuts to things you actually need.<br /><br />Windows 10 is a total failure, the people claiming it to be Windows Christ are simply dreaming or paid to say so, stick to windows 7/8.1. Windows 10 is nothing like Windows 7, try it first on an old computer if you are curious. If you hate Windows 8, Windows 10 will not improve anything, you will still be using the same failed phone/pc hybrid operating system but you will have to give up ALL your privacy for nothing you can't do on windows 7/8.1. Apparently you will also be paying for games like solitaire (1.49 a month) and 14.99 for a dvd/blue ray play back software.  Hopefully anyone can see where this is going.<br /><br />Interesting to note:<br /><br />How can users trust Microsoft when Windows 10 is nothing but SPYWARE? Microsoft's own definition of spyware is posted here [...]. The only way they get around their own definition is the fact that people are still &#34;Accepting&#34; the Privacy Policy to download the software.<br /><br />From Microsoft:<br /><br />What is spyware? What is spyware?<br /><br />With so many types of malicious software being spread around the Internet, it is important to be aware of what spyware is and what spyware does. Spyware is a general term used to describe software that performs certain behaviors, generally without appropriately obtaining your consent first, such as:<br /><br />•Advertising<br />•Collecting personal information<br />•Changing the configuration of your computer<br />Spyware is often associated with software that displays advertisements (called adware) or software that tracks personal or sensitive information.<br />Microsoft believes it &#34;appropriately&#34; obtains our consent to monitoring via the &#34;Privacy Policy&#34;.<br /><br />AVOID!!!<br />I will be upgrading to Windows 7/8.1 on my pc's while I have the chance to go back or in this case forward.<br /><br />*Aug 09 - Update:  The patch in question is KB3081424 (ironically enough a roll-up of bug fixes) and during its update process affected users find it fails and triggers the message: “We couldn’t complete the updates, undoing the changes.” Undoing them results in a mandatory system reboot, but as soon as the user logs back on Windows 10’s update process kicks in and tries to install KB3081424 again..	2015-08-03

We had 2014 which is almost unchanged hence a waste of money to upgrade. So we bought it, which I can accept. It turns out some genius in the marketing department decided to &#34;upgrade&#34; email invoicing to use an Intuit branded HTML email that you cannot alter or turn off. It has a huge dollar amount at the top which screams we're a desperate small company, and a new lovely branded &#34;Powered by Quickbooks&#34; with multiple links to Intuit in them whether you like it or not. So at this point, you can't go back to 2014, because they didn't patch a simple dll file so it would run on win 10 to intentionally push sales, or modify the email template.<br /><br />It's a company run by marketers these days and the product has gone years without real meaningful changes, the software sucks but they have the most support so the POS will survive until people/accountants wake up and demand more. Considering freshbooks now.	2015-08-03

Updates cost you an ongoing support license.  I have no problem with that.  They were up front about that and I knew it during the purchase.<br /><br />However the program checks for updates automatically and anytime there is a new version WITHOUT WARNING YOU THAT YOU WILL LOSE YOUR LICENSED COPY.  Yes that is right, if you forget and click to apply the update it will download and install and without warning wipe out your licensed version and put you back in a 14 day trial.  You have to go and PAY FOR IT AGAIN!!!<br /><br />This is equivalent to ransom ware.  (charging you money to get your files back)  Terrible practice.<br /><br />If this happens to anyone check your trash folder on your mac.  The old copy is there and thankfully you can get it back.  (no warning about that in the update installer either!)  Just delete the &#34;trial&#34; version they sneakily put in it's place and copy your old version back to your applications folder.<br /><br />Other than that the program works.  I'll give it three stars just because it runs the one program I need it to (QuickLoad reloading software).  Just be careful and TURN OFF checking for updates if you don't need them.  If the program you want to run under CrossOver works, there really isn't any need for updates.	2015-08-03

Even if you don't use this to actively make games, this is the ultimate way to teach yourself Ruby if you are aiming to learn a programming/scripting language of any kind. If you play RPG-esque games, having a lot of already-written code visible in the backend makes for easier grasping of concepts.

Yes, this OS is brand new and I only installed it today... but so far I have a great first impression.  It installed quickly, and it runs faster than Windows 7 did.  A pretty good feat considering that Windows 7 is six years old now.  Also it boots quickly, and does not have that bloated feel that older versions of Windows did.<br /><br />The interface is very clean and intuitive, but they also do not hide the power features too far away.  Against all odds, they have actually made the app store useful.<br /><br />With this download product, all I had to do was download the ISO and burn it to a DVD.  Then I copied in the serial number once during installation, and everything went smoothly.  I expected problems but did not have any.<br /><br />Microsoft wants to collect some usage statistics from Windows 10.  I was concerned that this would be hidden somehow, but actually during installation they came right out and said it (watch for the &#34;Express Options&#34; button, don't click that, and instead just click customize and all the options are there).  I was easily able to turn that feature off.<br /><br />Really a very fine OS so far.  Hopefully it will hold up...	2015-08-03

I had hope for Windows 10 after hearing people say &#34;it's just like windows 7 it's awesome&#34; my hope was quickly destroyed as soon as I clicked on the &#34;amazing&#34; new start button. You basically have the ugly, useless tile screen from windows 8 put into a box on your desktop, not a true start menu.  The start menu is made up of stupid, useless, ugly tile start screen apps, all apps list and if you scroll all the way to the bottom of the list you will find programs and accessories which is the only thing that should be there in the first place.<br /><br />Microsoft needs to give up on the stupid useless, app garbage on desktops. The search bar next to the &#34;start menu&#34; is laggy and brings up web search results etc. even if you simply search for a file on your pc, the relocation of simple features/settings is dumb and hiding things behind app style Windows 8 junk is not cool.<br /><br />Cortana sucks, again the search is laggy and to even use it you need to basically let the program monitor your every move and keystroke. Microsoft used to pride itself on respecting users privacy calling out data miners like google but as you may have guessed by reading the revised versions of their user agreement they sent out prior to releasing Windows 10 that is no longer the case. Windows 10 will track your every move or click, apps can read every message or conversation and data mine your entire PC in every nook and cranny including personal files on your hard drive.  If you don’t believe it check out the settings on any program you open and see for yourself. You will now see notifications, news stories and ads on your lock screen (what is this a damn phone) and every time you launch the new edge browser you will get MSN top stories/ads. There are literally a hundred options you need to turn off to not have your every click tracked and sent to Microsoft and advertisers...even if you turn them off they are still on in another menu somewhere else, do you understand why it's free...more like freemium.<br /><br />The new edge browser simply sucks compared to any other browsers out there including internet explorer. When you launch edge it gives you an infinite scrolling screen of MSN news and ads that you cannot turn off, at least I cannot find a way to do it, with a search bar saying &#34;where to next&#34; where you can do a web search with bing. I wanted to change my web search to Yahoo but it required going to yahoo.com then opening then new edge menu bar, and adding it then setting it to default, users on windows 7/8 will have trouble with this as it can be very tricky to find. I didn't find many positives with edge, it loads up decently but what’s the use when you have an a fraction of the options and customizations you have with any other browser and the fact that Edge doesn’t support a lot of websites hence why Windows 10 still has Internet Explorer tucked away. I can draw on the web page I’m looking at....whoopee, it's the app version of internet explorer on Windows 8 with Microsoft paint integration.<br /><br />The OS feels more like a phone than ever before.  If you boot up windows 8.1 then took a windows phone and laid it on the bottom left corner of the pc monitor screen you have Windows 10. It almost runs like an advertising tool for Microsoft to sell you useless crap via tiles and notifications popping up. I tried playing my games that I was running fine on Windows 8.1/7 and there are many issues and graphics issues. Some games like Borderlands/Borderlands 2 have major graphic issues now where bushes and bullets look like paint blotches splattered on the screen no matter how much you play with the video options. Dead Island, Left 4 Dead 2 and Dying Light will not work at all, they simply crash when launched so I’m wondering if my ATI Radeon card is having windows 10 update issues as they worked on 8.1.  WOW just stopped working as well, battle.net app freezes and looses track of where the files are stored on my PC, but now works fine since I deleted this Microsoft spyware off my PC and went back to 8.1.<br /><br />Windows 10 update will override the drivers installed by your graphics card suite causing crashes, graphical problems and infinite restarts if the driver you have installed is not the one big brother has in their auto update. Again I had hopes that Microsoft would actually deliver a quality product like Windows 7 but instead we get a lazy freemium version of windows 8.1 that rivals google it terms of disgusting spying/data stealing for profit. Windows 10 is &#34;freemium&#34; not free, you pay for it by giving up every ounce of privacy for Microsoft’s financial benefit.  They baseically turn your PC into a Microsoft server, your PC can also be used to upload updates to other pc users/owners like a hotspot.<br /><br />I’m glad that I switched to OSX again a few months back and only use windows on my secondary computer, I won’t be putting this garbage on my mac. If you do upgrade the first thing you should do is go into every settings menu you can find and check the privacy options, you will still be data mined just not as badly. You will have to do this more than once as there are for example two control panels....named the same but both with their own privacy settings.  The split personality of Windows 8 is back in full effect . In short Windows 10 is just Windows 8.1 freemium edition, you even still have to right click the start menu to get control panel (one of them) and stuff quickly because if you traditionally left click on it, it wil just shows you apps and useless tile garbage, basically the Windows 8 start screen in a box instead of desktop features and shortcuts to things you actually need.<br /><br />Windows 10 is a total failure, the people claiming it to be Windows Christ are simply dreaming or paid to say so, stick to windows 7/8.1. Windows 10 is nothing like Windows 7, try it first on an old computer if you are curious. If you hate Windows 8, Windows 10 will not improve anything, you will still be using the same failed phone/pc hybrid operating system but you will have to give up ALL your privacy for nothing you can't do on windows 7/8.1. Apparently you will also be paying for games like solitaire (1.49 a month) and 14.99 for a dvd/blue ray play back software.  Hopefully anyone can see where this is going.<br /><br />Interesting to note:<br /><br />How can users trust Microsoft when Windows 10 is nothing but SPYWARE?

I am a 20+-year user of Quicken for Windows and had to switch over to a Mac. So I bought this. It is awful in every regard, UNLESS your only planned use is as an electronic checkbook register.  I finally went with Quicken 2015 Deluxe for Windows using Parallels. I haven't had a moment's difficulty, save some very minor downloading issues with my credit union. (This has occurred in prior versions too. Not sure it's Quicken's fault.) Software you'll need is (1) Windows $120.00. I use Windows 8; I think Windows 7 is ok too. (2) Parallels $80.00. (3) Quicken Deluxe 2015. I had no trouble getting up and running, and it works like a charm on my MacBook Pro. I have the latest version of OSX but had all of this installed while I had the OSX version just prior to the current one.  If you asked me to rate that combination and setup, I'd give it five stars.  Save yourself some grief. DO NOT BUY Quicken for Mac.	2015-08-02

The program does relieve one of the stress that is the coding behind making templates for websites, but lacks a few things. It's a starter kit bundled with pre-made templates in the program. You can make a custom layout using bits and pieces to accommodate the look of your website with the varied features in it, but some you need to upgrade to Website X5 Evolution to use which also provides you with access to a server to upload everything and have it running which Compact 11 is missing. I kind of do miss the coding since that's started how I started in the beginning on Adobe Dreamweaver with html, css, and php making sitea on Drupal and Wordpress just since Adobe changed their approach to their programs I used this as an alternative. With more practice, tinkering, and a bit more money going towards upgrading to a more superior version for the extra bits and pieces for your stuff to function properly it can really work well. Just go into further investigating the programs and what they provide before you buy it and get screwed over causing you to buy something else that has only one extra feature that the one you bought from the beginning should of had from the start.	2015-08-02

Not only is this a crippled product but it also constitutes a security risk!  Why?<br />1.)  The program attempts to connect and transmit data to the Intuit serves on multiple occassions.  Why does it need to do this?  Updating the CD software once, makes the software UNUSABLE without an internet connection constantly on.<br />2.)  The program will not let you print without connecting to the servers either.  So, basically, after doing my taxes, I was forced to either give Intuit access to my data or redo by hand.  Needless to say I re-did everything by hand.<br /><br />Finally the product is completely crippled without an internet connection.  Because there is no mention of this on the packaging, I will contact the attorney general in the state of Illinois.  This is false representation.  This product is simply a rip-off, if you need to work offline!  Further, it gives you no provision to protect your data by forcing you to constantly let it talk to the Intuit servers!	2015-08-02

Every upgrade is harder to use and more buggy.  I would recommance Macgo blu ray dvd soft for PC. Only $39.95 easy to use and work on many generations of windows.

I thought I'd be shackled to saving documents in RTF through the simple text editor provided with the program, but was pleasantly surprised to find Version 13 works with Microsoft Word 2007, regardless the software requirements for version 13 specify it works with a much later version.<br /><br />I was previously using IBM's Via Voice on a Windows XP netbook and needed something that works on my HP laptop running 8.1 (which was targeted for use by a college student, so it hasn't a great lot of RAM or the best processor). I was wary after reading the multiple negative reviews, but decided to take the risk (regardless Amazon will not give you a refund on software downloads if the program won't work for you; so buyer beware).<br /><br />I did have to download the package twice. The first time, certain .dll files didn't unpack correctly and Amazon's installation told me to download a fresh package. It took two hours each time (on broadband) for the download to complete, but it's a huge program, so deal with it. The second time, it installed and registered itself without a hitch. I'm not ecstatic about having to &#34;open an account&#34; with Nuance in order to register the software, but that's Nuance's marketing issue, not Amazon's.<br /><br />To make this software work correctly, you DO have to BE PATIENT, take your time, and give the app decent samples of your voice over time. One time is not enough, but the initial reading is dictated by the program; subsequent &#34;readings&#34; come from the documents you dictates. The initial reading choice ranges from &#34;Charlie & and the Chocolate Factory&#34; to Arthur Clarke's &#34;3001: A Space...whatever it is&#34;.<br /><br />You DO have to SLOW DOWN, BE PATIENT, and help the program interpret yourvoice the first few times you use the software. So if you're expecting to be able to dictate *Doctor Zhivago* first thing out of the box, you'll want to table that plan for a couple of days.<br /><br />You DO have to let it analyze additional dictation samples and train the program so it will work faster and better for you. Do try to remember that it knows how to work with myriad international accents, so it's got a few things to work out regarding how you speak -- which isn't like anyone else on the planet, so hey! you're looking at an invention that would be considered magic a couple hundred years ago. BE PATIENT and maybe a little grateful, and it will work better for you the longer you use it.<br /><br />I didn't find the correction feature cumbersome at all -- IF you take the time to download the &#34;Cheatsheet&#34; list of voice commands from Nuance (just google for &#34;Dragon NaturallySpeaking 13 Cheatsheet&#34; and you'll be led to the PDF for download), and IF you take the time to download and look at &#34;Dragon NaturallySpeaking Workbook&#34; and the user guide (again google for them). The program works a lot faster and better if you use the voice commands. On the other hand, if you're impatient and don't wanna learn the commands...if you're determined to edit by highlighting and retyping text, well then, prepare to be frustrated.<br /><br />The more you use your voice, the more this Dragon becomes your personal friend.<br /><br />Be warned that the first hour or so of dictation, Dragon will...be...slow to type what you say. It will lag severely. This is because it's learning about you. BE PATIENT and use the &#34;Acoustic and Language Model Optimizer&#34; (see the User Guide or poke around in the &#34;Audio&#34; menu) after you dictate each sizable document, and (again) BE PATIENT enough to give Dragon the 20 or 60 minutes it needs to build a profile of how you speak so it can serve you better. (Yes, you have to do this repeatedly. Did you expect yourchild to walk the first time he or she managed to stand up?) You can schedule the Optimizer to do its analysis at 3 a.m. if you're impatient and don't want to wait around for it to finish.<br /><br />I'm using Dragon to dictate notes containing a lot of specific 15th-century terms including quotes from Parliamentary acts (in archaic-to-modern middle English) and weird city/town names. Behold! it already knows the names of people from the MIddle Ages (which surprised me), and it even knew how to spell 'oubliette,' which I wasn't expecting. (How many people use that word, after all?) It may have problems with Latin terms, but it's willing to learn. Once the word or phrase is entered and you take the time to record yourself saying it, the learning sticks. If you don't take the time to record the phrase, then don't whinge when Dragon doesn't recognize the phrase.<br /><br />Yes, you'll have to go hunting for the workbook, the user guide, and the cheatsheet of commands that Nuance provides if you want to use Dragon well. But hey, you were brave enough to download the program without a guide. Now go forth and find the guides you need to use the program and help it work with you.<br /><br />If you do, you'll find out it's an excellent writing partner. If you don't...then you might want to consider going back to the archaic dictation machine and a human assistant to type it all out for you. Or find someone who takes shorthand who will translate it to that even more ancient medium...paper.	2015-08-01

Been using PSP Xseries since PSP 2 and it works great for me with only minor issues with regard to how it does what it does.  Of course, all the hype about Adobe photoshop got me interested in seeking an even better alternative so I did their trial download. Photoshop costs a lot more, and it is certainly more powerful, but for what I do (restore old photos, create collages, prepare photos to use as icons, etc., it meets my needs wonderfully. My only critique would be that the &#34;soften&#34; function sometimes leaves telltale lines which then require further correction. For all that it does for the price tho, that's a very minor issue. You can do quick photo adjustments or extensive adjustments, or both. I've attached a couple of photos I took at Disney world. You can see how the program helps you make significant changes in order to make the pic show as what you want it to.	2015-08-01

Somewhat disappointed, and may look elsewhere for another typing tutor for our child. The main problem is apparently (from our experience with the UI) that it forces the child to type very long passages using the current keyset before moving on to other keys or keysets. This blocks learning other keys, making it easy for the child to lose interest in continuing with the program. Yes, the island metaphors are cool, but being forced to overcome obstacles to get to the next island should only be provided as a game strategy in parallel to allowing a child to select and learn keys according to their wishes to keep progressing at their own pace.	2015-07-31

I have tried to use Bitdefender Total Security on Windows 7. It will not run a full scan. It freezes during the attempt. I gave up on Bitdefender and downloaded Windows Security Essentials. It does everything Bitdefender does and it is free! Use it in conjunction with the Windows firewall and Malware and you don't need to spend a penny. To make matters worse, they charged my PayPal account for a renewal that I did not authorize and will not refund my money. Stay away!	2015-07-31

I want to give lots of info, but I will try my best to make it simple and short for all the readers.<br /><br />░░░░░INFO░░░░░<br />❖ Simple way to describe Windows 10: It combines the strengths of Windows 8 with Windows 7. Allot of people hated that Microsoft took away old Startup screen and If you look at few of my pictures below they kind of brought it back in Windows 10.<br /><br />❖ Windows 10 will be available in two versions: Home (price: should be 109.99) and Professional version (should be 149.99). And Windows 10 Mobile for smart phones.<br /><br />░░░░░WINDOWS 10 VS WINDOWS 8/8.1░░░░░<br />❖ Start Button is back<br /><br />❖ Cortana coming to PCs<br /><br />❖ Microsoft Edge, a new web browser for Windows 10<br /><br />*Users will be able to annotate any web page using finger/stylus or keyboard input.<br />*Spartan will have a reading mode.<br />*The Cortana voice assistant will be integrated into the browser.<br /><br />❖ The end of the password<br /><br />*According to Microsoft, users will be able to sign into commonly used apps like Outlook using a variety of biometric tools from fingerprint readers to retina scanners.<br />*You can still have password. But they are trying to make it harder to crack the password incase computer is stolen.<br /><br />❖ Multiple desktops windows, kind of like how apple has it on their computers<br /><br />░░░░░Prepare for Windows 10 install/upgrade░░░░░<br />❖ If you are running latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update You can reserve your free upgrade in the Get Windows 10 App. Once you reserve by providing your EMAIL ADDRESS, Windows 10 will download AUTOMICALLY when available, and you can cancel your reservation at any time.<br /><br />This is from Microsoft website:<br /><br />\\"Yes, free! This upgrade offer is for a full version of Windows 10, not a trial. 3GB download required; standard data rates apply. To take advantage of this free offer, you must upgrade to Windows 10 within one year of availability. Once you upgrade, you have Windows 10 for free on that device.\\"<br /><br />*NOTE: you must have all latest updates done on either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 in order to see the shortcut to reserve Windows 10. White windows logo Shortcut will show up where your clock is located on Taskbar notification area. I provided picture below that points to the icon with blue arrow in the picture.<br /><br />❖ Minimum System requirements to install the Windows 10 are:<br /><br />*Latest OS: Make sure you are running the latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update.<br />*Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC<br />*RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit<br />*Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS<br />*Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver<br />*Display: 1024x600<br /><br />░░░░░PRO'S░░░░░<br />❖ It actually has a Start menu now<br /><br />❖ Free upgrade for everyone (that's new)<br /><br />❖ Cortana, your truly personal digital assistant still available, its Microsoft version of Apple sari. It will be pre-loaded into Windows 10. Cortana will be able to provide regional specific answers to questions. Users will also be able to access Cortana's Notebook at any time to see what the AI knows about you and add or remove information.<br /><br />❖ Xbox is coming to Windows: Start recording gameplay in seconds, compete against console players, and stream games from your Xbox One console to your Windows 10 device from anywhere in your home.<br /><br />❖ Apps don't go away as seen in pictures below.<br /><br />❖ Office 2003 cannot be installed on windows 10. But 2007, 2010, 2013 and upcoming 2016 office will be compatible. I have tested 2007 and had minor issues. 2010 and 2013 work without any issues on Insider Preview Version of Windows 10.<br /><br />░░░░░CONS░░░░░<br />❖ Price is still up there. In case you are upgrading from XP or just going to buy a full copy. 109.99 or 149.99<br /><br />❖ Viruses are still an issue. Apple OSX has done a decent job. Apple can still catch viruses now days. But windows computer are ridicules when it comes to catching virus. So antivirus is def. needed.<br /><br />This statement is form Microsoft website directly:<br /><br />\\"If your computer is running Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP, Windows Defender removes spyware, but to protect yourself from viruses, you'll need to download antivirus software. You can purchase it from a third party, or you can download Microsoft Security Essentials for free.\\"<br /><br />From statement above I can tell you that Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Defender are useless. I personally dont even like the free Anti-viruses out their. I preferred paid ones that also have tech support to help you. Every company will give you a free and then has a paid one. With paid ones are their priority when a new virus comes out and they need to release the deification to general public to block it. That being said: there is not perfect antivirus out there. New infection arise on the internet every minute.<br /><br />As far as Apple OSX goes. Well remember that if you want to develop apple application their are requirements that you have to fallow per apple. They verify apps or you will get a notification like: application is from unidentified developer. So viruses are little harder to create on Apple. But they are coming too. VS Windows computer: Microsoft doesn't care about who makes what, they are too open and that is why they will probably never have a virus free Operating System.<br /><br />❖ Windows Media Center, and Windows 7 desktop gadgets are no longer included.<br /><br />❖ Windows Live Essentials installed on your system, the OneDrive application is removed and replaced with the inbox version of OneDrive.<br /><br />❖ Solitaire, Minesweeper, and Hearts Games that come pre-installed on Windows 7 will be removed as part of installing the Windows 10 upgrade. Microsoft has released their version of Solitaire and Minesweeper called the \\"Microsoft Solitaire Collection\\" and \\"Microsoft Minesweeper.\\"<br /><br />❖ Watching DVDs requires separate playback software now. I USE VLC PLAYER ANYWAY. NEVER LIKED WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER. VLC SUPPORTS FAR MORE FORMATS, INCLUDING BLU-RAY PLAYBACK.<br /><br />░░░░░BOTTOM-LINE░░░░░<br />I think it's defiantly worth trying Windows 10. I still think Microsoft needs to test it little longer in Beta face before releasing it. It will have issues here and there like all their previous operating systems. But I think it will be have allot less glitches compare to Windows 8/8.1 release. Free upgrade why not. I will update this review again once the official version is released to general public.<br /><br />░░░░░FAQ(SOME OF THESE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED BY MICROSOFT ON THERE WEBSITE)░░░░░<br /><br />Q: Is the upgrade really free?<br />A: Yes, it's free. This is a full version of Windows, not a trial or introductory version. It is available for a limited time: you have one year from the time Windows 10 is available to take advantage of this offer.<br /><br />Q: How long does it take to install the upgrade?<br />A: Plan for about an hour for the installation.

He then told me that I need to uninstall the H&RB state of NJ software off of my computer and then reinstall it so that the NJ return would start from the beginning - that is NUTS!

The trouble is, most of their technology is not geared at consumers.  The strange thing is some of their competitors in the consumer market use Amazon as their back-end.<br /><br />As it stands today, this download is basically confusing and half-baked.  It serves only one purpose.  You drag files into it, and it uploads them into your account.  When I launched the program, it told me I had about 150 MB of space left (yes MB... not GB), but it had links telling me that it's now &#34;Unlimited&#34; for Prime Members, but that wasn't clear either.  Apparently unlimited only applies to photos.  Videos and other files are not unlimited.  They give you 5GB for that.  5GB isn't even enough space for 10 minutes of high definition video, so if you have a photo library that has videos, you're going to need to upgrade to the next level... the true &#34;Unlimited&#34; version, which is $59 per year.<br /><br />Assuming you get past all that, all this program does is let you upload your files by dragging them.  It doesn't sync, so you'll have to remember which files you uploaded, so you can remember which ones need to be uploaded later.<br /><br />Once the files are there, that's it.  It doesn't actually let you do anything with them within the program itself.  It gives you links to their web site to view or download them. One interesting thing about the website link was that it not only showed me files uploaded using this program, but it also shows you any personal documents such as PDFs and ebook files that you've uploaded to your Kindle.  It's interesting, but not useful, because I can already do that on the Kindle itself.<br /><br />I think Amazon needs to re-think their consumer cloud strategy.  It seems to me that they need to decide if they are serious about building a consumer cloud product.  As it stands right now, DropBox, OneDrive, iCloud, Google Drive, iDrive and others are far more consumer friendly, and useful.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because of the potential, not because it's actually useful today.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.  Questions and comments are welcome.and useful.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because of the potential, not because it's actually useful today.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.

BEWARE, I bought this to upgrade from an old Quicken Essentials that was no longer being supported and it no longer imported my credit union transactions.  I bought QuickBooks Mac instead because of the bad reviews for the current Quicken version.  Unbelievably, this software does not download from my credit union either.  Even though they are on the list of banking entities.  When I called QuickBooks they got someone from my credit union on the phone who said that &#34;hopefully it will work by the end of the month&#34;.  The QuickBooks person apologized but her only solution was for me to manually enter each transaction (for 9 accounts), no thanks, for that I spent $182!  On top of all that it won't import any of my Quicken data into QuickBooks!!!!  Useless and no refunds!!!	2015-07-31

Spent $200 and can't manually enter data and run a payroll check. They want a MONTHLY FEE. They are full of cr*p. If I pay for something, I should be able to use the features on the box. OTHERWISE, don't advertise those features on the box. You can enter an employee's hours into the embeded timesheet, the software still isn't going to let you run a payroll check. If you are going to pay a monthly fee (scam) for software you bought for listed features, might as well use ADP! At least they are up front.	2015-07-31

I do use it in conjunction with ancestry.com to manage my family trees for personal genealogy research, but I believe someone would also find it useful without an ancestry subscription.  Some of the features I've found quite useful are the ability to set up filters you can save to search for certain family members and to add your own fields and history notes.  I'm also using FTM to maintain family trees for characters in a novel I am working on.  The fact that I can add historical notes that will then be visible when reviewing specific characters is quite useful.  Some of the filters I've set up are to locate family members who might have been the right age to serve in the military during specific wars from the Revolutionary War to the present.  I've also set up a few to allow me to review deaths during periods when epidemics such as the 1918 flu were rampant in the area where the people live.  In each case, I'm able to produce a list of people then check for details that I might otherwise miss in their histories.  Considering that my main tree, which I began based on extensive research my grandmother started, contains nearly 2000 people, being able to set up such filters and save them is quite convenient.  Since I can add items to the history listings, and they'll show up alongside a person's dates, I can easily look at the individuals to see what kinds of records I might be able to find to support such things as their military service records.  You're also able to add notes on where you left off or what other things you might want to look at next so that, when you have to put down your research for an extended period and pick it up again later, you're able to get back into it without losing too much time figuring out where you were.<br /><br />You're also able to generate quite a few reports, including various standard charts and reports such as the Ahnentafel report, various trees, descendants, etc.  But you also have the ability to create &#34;smart stories&#34; that produce a more textual representation of your work and even custom reports.  There's also an option to create a book based on your work.<br /><br />I've used earlier versions of FTM in the past.  I've been working on genealogy research for more than 20 years, off and on.  I find that the current versions of this software are much improved.  Syncing with Ancestry works well, though I've had a few mishaps when I didn't quite understand how to handle upgrades correctly.  For the most part, the software is pretty intuitive, if you're used to working on genealogy.  It is quite specialized, so someone who is new to genealogy work would really need to look at the manual for guidance when getting started.<br /><br />The software is quite useful and I'd definitely recommend it to others.  Though it does cost more than some genealogy software (I've used many other programs, including shareware and freeware products, as well), I believe you get a good value for the price.the ability to create &#34;smart stories&#34; that produce a more textual representation of your work and even custom reports.

It would freeze once in a while during a job. Learned to constantly save work. I opened it one day and it wouldn't run. It would give me an error code right away. If you go online you will see this is very common on 10 11 and 12. There are tons of different fixes in a lot of forums but none worked for me. I would of given it a better rating but if you look online a lot of people contacted Sony about the issue and would get the same answers. Uninstall and install again. Did not work for almost everyone.	2015-07-31

If I have over 1 terabyte of data on the cloud and I am looking to download a file of size 7GB I can not select it.  I need to download the whole cloud<br />library in order to get this file and if I have 1 TB of data on the cloud and my local hard drive is only 500GB (empty) I can't even do that. I also does not let you choose where you want to download all the data.  If always places it on your local hard drive.  So basically I can not retrieve that file ever again or unless I delete enough data from the cloud that it becomes as small as the available hard drive space.

I want to give lots of info, but I will try my best to make it simple and short for all the readers.<br /><br />░░░░░INFO░░░░░<br />❖ Simple way to describe Windows 10: It combines the strengths of Windows 8 with Windows 7. Allot of people hated that Microsoft took away old Startup screen and If you look at few of my pictures below they kind of brought it back in Windows 10.<br /><br />❖ Windows 10 will be available in two versions: Home (price: should be 109.99) and Professional version (should be 149.99). And Windows 10 Mobile for smart phones.<br /><br />░░░░░WINDOWS 10 VS WINDOWS 8/8.1░░░░░<br />❖ Start Button is back<br /><br />❖ Cortana coming to PCs<br /><br />❖ Microsoft Edge, a new web browser for Windows 10<br /><br />*Users will be able to annotate any web page using finger/stylus or keyboard input.<br />*Spartan will have a reading mode.<br />*The Cortana voice assistant will be integrated into the browser.<br /><br />❖ The end of the password<br /><br />*According to Microsoft, users will be able to sign into commonly used apps like Outlook using a variety of biometric tools from fingerprint readers to retina scanners.<br />*You can still have password. But they are trying to make it harder to crack the password incase computer is stolen.<br /><br />❖ Multiple desktops windows, kind of like how apple has it on their computers<br /><br />░░░░░Prepare for Windows 10 install/upgrade░░░░░<br />❖ If you are running latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update You can reserve your free upgrade in the Get Windows 10 App. Once you reserve by providing your EMAIL ADDRESS, Windows 10 will download AUTOMICALLY when available, and you can cancel your reservation at any time.<br /><br />This is from Microsoft website:<br /><br />\\"Yes, free! This upgrade offer is for a full version of Windows 10, not a trial. 3GB download required; standard data rates apply. To take advantage of this free offer, you must upgrade to Windows 10 within one year of availability. Once you upgrade, you have Windows 10 for free on that device.\\"<br /><br />*NOTE: you must have all latest updates done on either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 in order to see the shortcut to reserve Windows 10. White windows logo Shortcut will show up where your clock is located on Taskbar notification area. I provided picture below that points to the icon with blue arrow in the picture.<br /><br />❖ Minimum System requirements to install the Windows 10 are:<br /><br />*Latest OS: Make sure you are running the latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update.<br />*Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC<br />*RAM: 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit<br />*Hard disk space: 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS<br />*Graphics card: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver<br />*Display: 1024x600<br /><br />░░░░░PRO'S░░░░░<br />❖ It actually has a Start menu now<br /><br />❖ Free upgrade for everyone (that's new)<br /><br />❖ Cortana, your truly personal digital assistant still available, its Microsoft version of Apple sari. It will be pre-loaded into Windows 10. Cortana will be able to provide regional specific answers to questions. Users will also be able to access Cortana's Notebook at any time to see what the AI knows about you and add or remove information.<br /><br />❖ Xbox is coming to Windows: Start recording gameplay in seconds, compete against console players, and stream games from your Xbox One console to your Windows 10 device from anywhere in your home.<br /><br />❖ Apps don't go away as seen in pictures below.<br /><br />❖ Office 2003 cannot be installed on windows 10. But 2007, 2010, 2013 and upcoming 2016 office will be compatible. I have tested 2007 and had minor issues. 2010 and 2013 work without any issues on Insider Preview Version of Windows 10.<br /><br />░░░░░CONS░░░░░<br />❖ Price is still up there. In case you are upgrading from XP or just going to buy a full copy. 109.99 or 149.99<br /><br />❖ Viruses are still an issue. Apple OSX has done a decent job. Apple can still catch viruses now days. But windows computer are ridicules when it comes to catching virus. So antivirus is def. needed.<br /><br />This statement is form Microsoft website directly:<br /><br />\\"If your computer is running Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP, Windows Defender removes spyware, but to protect yourself from viruses, you'll need to download antivirus software. You can purchase it from a third party, or you can download Microsoft Security Essentials for free.\\"<br /><br />From statement above I can tell you that Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Defender are useless. I personally dont even like the free Anti-viruses out their. I preferred paid ones that also have tech support to help you. Every company will give you a free and then has a paid one. With paid ones are their priority when a new virus comes out and they need to release the deification to general public to block it. That being said: there is not perfect antivirus out there. New infection arise on the internet every minute.<br /><br />As far as Apple OSX goes. Well remember that if you want to develop apple application their are requirements that you have to fallow per apple. They verify apps or you will get a notification like: application is from unidentified developer. So viruses are little harder to create on Apple. But they are coming too. VS Windows computer: Microsoft doesn't care about who makes what, they are too open and that is why they will probably never have a virus free Operating System.<br /><br />❖ Windows Media Center, and Windows 7 desktop gadgets are no longer included.<br /><br />❖ Windows Live Essentials installed on your system, the OneDrive application is removed and replaced with the inbox version of OneDrive.<br /><br />❖ Solitaire, Minesweeper, and Hearts Games that come pre-installed on Windows 7 will be removed as part of installing the Windows 10 upgrade. Microsoft has released their version of Solitaire and Minesweeper called the \\"Microsoft Solitaire Collection\\" and \\"Microsoft Minesweeper.\\"<br /><br />❖ Watching DVDs requires separate playback software now. I USE VLC PLAYER ANYWAY. NEVER LIKED WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER. VLC SUPPORTS FAR MORE FORMATS, INCLUDING BLU-RAY PLAYBACK.<br /><br />░░░░░BOTTOM-LINE░░░░░<br />I think it's defiantly worth trying Windows 10. I still think Microsoft needs to test it little longer in Beta face before releasing it. It will have issues here and there like all their previous operating systems. But I think it will be have allot less glitches compare to Windows 8/8.1 release. Free upgrade why not. I will update this review again once the official version is released to general public.<br /><br />░░░░░FAQ(SOME OF THESE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED BY MICROSOFT ON THERE WEBSITE)░░░░░<br /><br />Q: Is the upgrade really free?<br />A: Yes, it's free. This is a full version of Windows, not a trial or introductory version. It is available for a limited time: you have one year from the time Windows 10 is available to take advantage of this offer.<br /><br />Q: How long does it take to install the upgrade?<br />A: Plan for about an hour for the installation. Newer devices may only take 20 minutes, and older devices may take more than an hour. You'll need to download the installation files beforeyou begin.

Click \\"Customize\\" in the System Tray and turn off the Get Windows 10 app notifications in the menu that comes up.<br /><br />Q: What edition of Windows will I get as part of this free upgrade?<br />A: If your Windows7/Windows 8 was Starter, Home Basic or Home Premium: you will get Home version automatically. If your Windows7/Windows 8 was Professional or Ultimate: You will get Pro version automatically. If you have Home and want pro. You will have to buy it when its available on Amazon July 29th. Please note that Microsoft will provide Digital and DVD pack for Windows 10.<br /><br />Q: Can Enterprise customers get the free Windows 10 upgrade?<br />A: Enterprise customers with active Software Assurance subscription in volume licensing have the benefit to upgrade to Windows 10 enterprise offerings outside of this offer.<br /><br />Q: Will I get all of the features of Windows 10 once I upgrade?<br />A: Some Windows 10 features will require advanced hardware and not all features and services are available on every device, nor in every market. For instance, Cortana is not available in all markets.<br /><br />Q: Will my devices and apps work with Windows 10?<br />A: Windows 10 is designed to be compatible with the vast majority of Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 devices -- so your device is most likely compatible.<br /><br />For details on your specific device and apps, you can use the Get Windows 10 app to do a compatibility check.

The point of this is to upload files to your Drive.<br /><br />A)  Had to find out the hard way- YOU CAN NOT UPLOAD FILES BIGGER THAN 50GB.  Why say unlimited if you are going to restrict size?<br />B)  Their upload speed makes no sense.  It's not based on your ISP.  I am doing this at work with a clean fiber connection with 100MB upload.  I have to quit/restart over and over again because it keeps uploading at 4-5MB and after many many tries, it will jump to 70MB upload speed, which is what I expect to get.  Even in the middle of the night.<br />C)  It's stupid when you can create FOLDERS on the web portal but you can not upload to these folder from this app.  You have to upload it to the home folder and do a bunch of moving.<br /><br />How are you suppose to know when there's a new version of the desktop app?  No option to check for update.<br /><br />Running version 2.4.2	2015-07-31

It's okay, though I prefer Norton.  McAfee seems to constantly pop-up throughout the year begging you to buy more stuff or add an automatic subscription.  To renew is 40 bucks, so I went back to Amazon to buy a whole new installation for $9.  I am now on the SEVENTH attempt to install.  Each time, it gets a little further before it stalls, so I guess I'll get there eventually.  I regret buying this, knowing I didn't like it last year.  I should have spent a couple of dollars more for Norton.  If Amazon gave refunds on software, believe me- I would can this mess.	2015-07-31

Big improvement over Windows 8.1.  Faster than Windows 7.  Start Menu!!!  Working Windows key to launch Start Menu.  The Start Menu is customizable live tiles, sort of like the Windows 8 GUI only on a smaller scale.  It is cell phone size, so if you have a WindowsPhone it will be very familiar.  Customizable keyboard short cuts.  There is an option to turn &#34;Tablet Interface&#34; on or off and &#34;Boot only to Desktop&#34; option.  Could go on, but you get the idea.  When installing it will ask about music and video associations.  Suggest you deny until you see the Windows 10 interface.  MPC-HC x64 plays video better than Windows 10 &#34;Movies & TV.&#34;  * Install requires an email and password.  Recommend you set up an Outlook or Live (used to be called Hotmail) account to link to the OS before installing.  After Installation you can add additional email(s) if you want one click access through Outlook.  After install, your schedule and documents and ______ will all be linked and will follow you across multiple devices.  With the Outlook or Live account you will have free access to MS Office on the internet.  (Clear throat noise) Great for cell phones and temporary PC usage.

When my spouse started a new business and we had to track expenses in more detail, I decided to upgrade to Quicken/Windows.  I did not like it as much as MS Money, but a large part of the dissatisfaction was likely due to my extreme knowledge of MS Money while having to learn about Quicken/Windows differences and idiosyncrasies.  However, we recently had to buy a new home computer and changed to an Apple Mac, so we had to change to Quicken/Apple.  What a disappointment.  The good news is that I was able to rather easily import all my past years' data (first from MS Money to Quicken/Windows and then to Quicken/Apple).  But there is more negative to report than there is positive.  There is significant functionality missing in the Apple version of software compared to the Windows version.  A few examples:  When viewing an account, you can not limit the transaction views to the unreconciled ones or just the last few months' transactions.  The only option is to have the screen list every last transaction you ever made in that account.  In my case, that can be 10 years worth of data, most of which I want to keep but not display at all times.  Reporting is very limited.  A small number of stock reports are available and they can be modified and saved.  But you can not export the report to a spreadsheet; you can only print it out or save a PDF of the report.  Quicken help tells you that to export the data which makes up the report, you have to manually export the raw data yourself and create your own report!  Not useful.  And when you want help from Quicken, there is absolutely no phone or live support.  Everything is done through forums & feedback on-line.  From what I read on Quicken's support forums and from my short experience so far, Quicken/Windows is where most of Quicken's technical support & development goes. They apparently have little interest or little desire to support the Apple version in an equivalent manner.  My suggestion is to stick to Quicken/Windows or find another vendor if you must use an Apple environment.	2015-07-30

Killing everything it encountered, quarantining everything in disarray..

Then a box appeared that said something like Please Wait--We're preparing for the upgrade. So I waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, I went to bed and found the PC in the same state the next morning. Something must have gone wrong. Trying to close with the X did nothing. Using right-click and &#34;close&#34; on the task bar icon did nothing. So, I forced a shutdown using the on/off button and rebooted.<br />Then the upgrade pretty much went on its own. After another hour or two, it restarted and it's running OK. I have not used it much and will further update with more experiences.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />Got my upgrade notice and immediately downloaded from Microsoft and upgraded my Surface Pro 3 with it.<br />The upgrade experience was seamless. The whole process took less than an hour with no intervention from the user except in the first few minutes to agree to the license agreement, etc. Then the upgrade ran itself, including restarting.<br />Then we have to select express or custom setup. The express setup essentially sends Microsoft all the data it wants regarding your surfing habits, location, default apps for pictures and videos, music, etc. I selected custom setup and picked and chose what I wanted to share. Again, this was fast and painless.<br />I'm using the Edge browser on Amazon to type this. It loaded fast and has worked seamlessly so far. However, I can't find a way to use setting to specify my multiple start pages, like all other browsers, and have to add as custom pages one at a time. Irritating.<br />I was also a tester for the preproduction versions. This is based on my experience with them as well.<br />The best thing is that Windows is now equally touch and keyboard-mouse friendly. You can have it in tablet mode and maximize the square icons display. You can also resize it to become a squarish start menu that occupies only the lower left corner of the display. The difference is that it shows live feeds such as weather, news, and stock market indices. It's as mouse friendly as it is touch friendly. Nice.<br />I timed the start up. It took about 12 seconds from pushing the power button on my Surface Pro 3 for the login screen to appear. The wireless took about 15 seconds to connect to my wi-fi. By the time I typed in my password, it's all good to go, 20 seconds or less. The fast start up of W8 was what prompted me to upgrade from W7 to W8 and I'm glad this was retained.<br />There is a prominent search window next to the Start icon where you can search without having to start a browser.<br />Next to Search is a Task icon. Clicking it brings all open apps in tiles on the main screen. It's not gimmicky at all and very convenient to switch tasks.<br />So far everything works as when I was using W8.1. It's as seamless as any Windows upgrade that I had done. No complaints.<br />Microsoft's goal is to fix the defects of W8 without losing its advantages while adding goodies. Looks like they have hit the mark.<br />I'll keep on testing and will update with further experiences.custom setup and picked and chose what I wanted to share. Again, this was fast and painless.

I have used this checkbook register for at least 10 years.  Not bad.  I used the free version for many years then later when wanting to transfer my data to a new computer, I paid for the upgrade.  Since then I have been contacted twice to get their free updates and upgrades.  I bought a chromebook last year and didn't realize you can't install anything on it, so I began using clearcheckbook.com  It's weird to use and I just had never had any problems or confusion with the Dataware checkbook.  My husband took over the chromebook and I got a new laptop and immediately downloaded the checkbook register again so I can see where I'm at on my bills and income.	2015-07-30

I immediately started seeing problems.  The most annoying is that the Windows shortcut keys don't work consistently (and yes, I've got all the correct Preferences checked), forcing me to restart the program in the middle of entering transactions.  I've never had this problem with any of the earlier versions of Quicken.  This happens unpredictably, but often after I've left the computer for a few hours and then returned to enter more transactions.  I tried dealing with Tech Support Chat, but the agent couldn't tell me anything more than I already knew how to do.  her advice was to use the Quicken Standard shortcuts, rather than Windows Standard.  This is not a fix, but simply ignores the problem.  I don't want to have to train myself to not use Windows shortcuts in Quicken, when I can use them in dozens upon dozens of other programs.  They're supposed to work in Quicken and they don't.  That's a problem that needs fixing, not avoiding.<br /><br />Other issues seem to come and go, with no rhyme or reason.<br /><br />I wish there was another financial management program I could use that would sync with my bank, but I haven't heard of one.  Here's a business of for some bright programmer!	2015-07-29

I should have paid more attention to disgruntled update customers, attributing most of that to being perturbed about being 'forced' to upgrade to continue some of the features you have become used to.  I have updated many times over past 15 years or so, and usually the upgrades offer little substantive improvement, but I have not had the disastrous experiences others have warned about in the past.  Not so this time, converting from QP 12 to QP 15 has resulted in one of the most annoying and frustrating afternoons I can ever recall.  It uploaded quickly enough, and my information may have been converted, but I have no way of knowing it because the screens are all screwed up.  The screen is mostly white, with data in thin ribbon on left, which will not enlarge.  I can occassionally get a screen by going to partial screen mode, but switching between accounts goes back to blank, and then, the program crashes.  After some frustration, I tried the chat line but after sitting there for an hour while trying to work with it, I have given up.<br />Right now I am so frustrated that I would like to get a copy of the 2012 version and install that, and reload my saved driver and forget the online services that Quicken uses to force these upgrades to a product that used to be good, but has not significantly improved if you transition smoothly, and if you have the kind of problems I encountered, it is a bad joke.<br />I am going to try to	2015-07-29

Discontinued support (and functionality) of prior version, Quicken Essentials for Mac (which was great, BTW), forcing users to the new 2015 version.  Putting aside issues with a less appealing user interface, the root of the problem is simple:  the software just doesn't work.  Transaction dialogue box states transactions downloaded, but then none show up under individual accounts.  Work around is to delete linkages then reestablish linkages, daily per each account (one at a time).  Neat, fun.  Absolutely no contact info for Support - just user forums.

My old system used Aatrix payroll and I went for the intergrated option and got QB payroll. The monthly payroll fees are costing me $38 for 7 employees, that's $456 per year which is entirely too much. That's more than double what I was paying per year. There is no check designer, so they want you to buy checks from them, so that's another expense. I hand-type my payroll checks to avoid that expense. When I entered my back payroll, I ran into rounding errors on almost everybody so I had to jig with the figures to make the transition. When I entered the back payroll, I was assessed payroll fees just like QB had something to do with those payrolls, which it didn't. You know, I prefigure my payroll on a spreadsheet before I go on line to do the payroll. The way they are charging me, you would think that they are doing all my work! Additionally, the first time I was trying to do a live payroll, our internet went down and I had to go back to my old Aatrix program to do payroll, because QB is internet based. (My employees just wouldn't understand that they would have to wait until AT&T fixed our T line to get paid.)<br /><br />As this is an internet program, guess what, you don't get any kind of manual. They want you to go to FAQ's and find a problem kinda like yours so you can figure it out. I worked with the chat service. There is a big lag between responses like the chat line monitor is working with a bunch of people, so chat line service is really tedious.<br /><br />I haven't done any quarterly reports with QB, but because of the rounding problems I have encountered, I expect it to be a mess.<br />Overall, the program seems kinda clunky to me. I'm not particularly impressed with the look, design, speed, or ease of use.  But I can overlook a lot if the price is reasonable, but it is not reasonable.<br /><br />I see from other comments that it is also a sticky thing to transfer over to another program becausethey'll shut you out of your data.  I'll have to stay with them past the 4th quarter to get my information and start with somebody else.	2015-07-29

I've had this program for more than a year, I'd guess, and I'd be lost without it. I use it every day to record purchases from my checkbook and transfers to my savings accounts, also available with this program. There is a companion program, Credit Card Manager, that I also use every day and recommend both very highly. Why only 4 stars? Well, it IS a no-frills program. There are probably a lot of little things I might want to add to it but it works fast and easy as-is and is a solid product. I replaced other, more expensive, complicated programs with this and after about a day of using it, never missed them at all.	2015-07-29

I have decades of home movies on DVD that I needed to convert to mp4 files for eventual upload to the Amazon Cloud.  The conversions were relatively speedy--only about 20-30 minutes for a two hour DVD.  But then I started noticing that most of the files were incomplete; they cut off well before the end of the segment, with the image frozen for the remainder of the clip.  I tried converting these same DVDs using the free WinX converter software.  The WinX software had its own problems; but the image and sound quality was just as good as the Movavi conversions and, most important, all segments were complete.  I ended up using the WinX sofrware for the DVD-to-mp4 conversions and the Movavi software just to trim the files to the desired length.  I wrote to Movavi about the problem (with copies of converted video files to demonstrate the issue), but their eventual response--several weeks later--was incomprehensible, at least to me:  &#34;Please try to copy all the VOB files from your DVDs on your hard drive (please make sure not to copy INO files) and try to convert it again.&#34;  Translation for the non-tech types?	2015-07-29

It was so bad, i couldn't even click links on ccleaner or malwarebytes.  The malware stopped all options to download.  I couldn't install chrome or any other browser to avoid all the damage on IE..<br /><br />Finally got it clean and will install WR on her laptop.<br /><br />Now, the biggest issue with WR is their pricing strategy.  Many discuss it here, but the staff from WR are always vacant in their responses about this and ignoring it won't make it go away.<br /><br />When my sub expires in a few months, I likely will switch to Avast Free.  It's got great ratings, and in combination with Malwarebytes and ccleaner, it's a free solution without repaying year after year.<br /><br />Key to WR, and while i know you will ignore my post, as you've ignore ALL pricing references, the people who read these reviews ARE paying attention.  It is a terribly shortsited business model to make your repeat customer PAY MORE than new customers. . You can argue that it's a new customer bonus, but that's hogwash and you know it.  All you need to do is install it and it's on its own for the most part. And you can let it expire, reorder and get a new license for the best price you can find.<br /><br />Loyalty should be rewarded, not snubbed and mocked by insulting us by demanding we pay more than new customers.  Most companies offer the best price, in many cases lower than ANYTHING you can find online.. Some companies offer even lower advance or multiyear discounts as well.<br /><br />Come on WR, we're not insignificant, pay attention to us.  If we leave, you end up with nothing.	2015-07-29

I generally don't like Microsoft products, b/c just about the time I actually LEARN how to use one of the products, MS changes where all of the buttons and switches are.  Seriously, Microsoft ... stop changing everything in your software!  Improvements are fine ... but there is no need to move everything else around to do it.  (Have you finally go the message, now, with Windows Vista ... oops, I mean Windows 8?)<br /><br />The Office 365 product is OK ... I can use it on multiple devices ... but I just hate using MS programs, anyway.  And I don't like MS being able to keep such close &#34;track&#34; of me ... and such tight control ... of their products, through the internet.<br /><br />I suppose the advantage of having the &#34;latest version&#34; of these products is that ...well, you have the latest version, and it SHOULD be compatible ... and backwards compatible, with previous versions.  And the clear disadvantage, at least in my mind, is that the programs that you once knew how to use ... will change.  MS has been singly responsible for a substantial decrease in my personal productivity.<br /><br />With this type of software, at least through MS, you can expect that the second your subscription has expired, you'll no longer get to use your software, with out pulling your credit card out, again.<br /><br />When your subscription expires, you WILL be able to view your documents ... but will NOT be able to change them in any way.  So I feel &#34;held hostage&#34; by Microsoft.  And I am using more and more frequently the Open Office suite, which I prefer on most occasions.	2015-07-29

Combined the best they can do is about 90%  The worst thing on the planet for a PC is CrypoLocker.  As far as I know only Malwarebytes has the capability to intercept CrypoLocker. but its limited on what else it can do. Enter Kaspersky.  For some reason Kas can’t block CrypoLocker but it can block or quarantine a bunch of other  threats. As to installing Kas i had a recent problem using a Kas CD. My &#34;Malwarebytes&#34; would not let it install off the CD. Went to kaspersky.com and downloaded the trial version and.. Malwarebytes was OK with that process as I had giving my administrator approval it allow the down load in.  So I now I run both Mal and Kas on our PCs. But here’s the trick to it all.  “Automatically backup your stuff everyday”.  If you take a hit just tell the backup to start using an earlier date when you still had a clean machine. Your “data” is not affected.  And yes it true. The Apple Mac operating system cannot be infected with PC malware. But bozo’s feel compelled to write adware crud that inserts pop-up ads into YouTube downloads.  It's not malware its just harassment from high school Harry.	2015-07-28

The Android app is free and picks up on the Level you are at ... and iPad syncs up too so you can stay with the program.<br /><br />But first you have to activate the package on your PC, and this can be kinda tricky.<br />First download and install.  When you run it, it will check for updates.  DO NOT LET IT UPDATE.  Just say &#34;Update Later&#34; and then it will walk you through activating your package using the serial code given by Amazon.<br />Once you get to the first lesson, you are golden ... just start using your phone or your iPad from here on out.<br />In my experience, it won't matter whether or not you install the update to the PC version, because it simply wont work.  However, you have to avoid the first update to even activate your package, so if you are already stuck with the update, then you might as well uninstall and start over.	2015-07-28

It remove the old antivirus before installing itself and update the latest Antivirus definitions. Pretty smooth with only 1 reboot required after installation. My experience with Norton is they protect the PC much better than those free antivirus software especially if you are those who are not so tech savvy. Those freeware websites like to install advertisers add-ons and then slowly disable your antivirus software. Many people has complain about how slow Norton is but my experience is that it is hardly noticeable especially if you use a SSD. The key is to remove any existing antivirus software/s else they will start scanning one another resulting in the lag. If you cannot install Norton antivirus, it is likely that your PC is infected. I would have given it 5 stars if the 5 licenses expiry dates are base on when you activate them. The expiry date for all 5 devices starts when you activate the first one. Hence, it is good to start all the licenses at the same time.	2015-07-28

Used Norton for years, tried some others once but always come back to Norton.  I had problems a few days after installing and chatted with a Norton rep who downloaded a program to control my computer and all he did was reinstall the program - wish he had just told me to reinstall because I prefer to make my own choices.  Also, once this program is on your computer  it's difficult to remove!  Very upset with Norton over this incident.  Also, the tech was nice but he checked to allow my computer to participate in Norton's Cyber Crime program but I don't like to because it slows my computer down having all these monitors and spies on it.  The tech lied and told me that Cyber Crime was required and it kept the program updated.  Not a big deal, just wish I had done a few things differently.  Appreciate the lower price on Amazon.  Another issue that I have with Norton is their hundred different prices.  Even with all of these little issues, I still value the services provided by Norton and appreciate the program keeping most of the viruses and spies off of my computer.	2015-07-28

Sketchbook Pro 7 is a great program, but could use better tools for supporting 3D sketches.  It is these shortcomings that keep sketchbook Pro 7 from being my main tool for sketching - I find I still need CAD (ViaCAD) and Illustration (Inkscape) tools to create the geometry for many technical sketches, which are then finished off in Sketchbook and/or Krita.  This program is awesome with the pen on my Surface Pro 3.<br /><br />The perspective tool is great for the rectilinear stuff, but it would be really nice to be able to have a &#34;3D-smart&#34; ellipse tool as well (or at least one that allows you to &#34;save&#34; a few standard ellipse settings, so you could have multiple ellipse sizes to reuse like with a real ellipse template.  As it is, if you need to duplicate an ellipse, you have to spend a lot of fiddly time moving, rotating, and resizing the ellipse tool to only sort-of replicate an ellipse you drew before.<br /><br />Likewise, another huge addition would be the ability to create persistent construction/guide lines (preferably visible (but never printable) and active by layer) - like the ellipse tool, construction/guide lines are only defined until you reset the guide.	2015-07-28

Fortunately I found instructions that helped me on another Amazon review (see the reviews on the Rosetta Stone French Level 1 for Mac [Download] page by sreenivas nukala for slightly different instructions if mine don't work for you- but my instructions borrow heavily from theirs).  Note that the Rosetta Stone site does not provide viable instructions on how to to get the download working correctly (at least not where I could find them).<br /><br />Anyways, here's what I did:<br />1. First download and install... you will then go through a number of updates.<br />2. Once you finish with the updates, you will be stuck with the Rosetta Stone program requesting a CD for the language files (You obviously don't have a CD, but you should have the language files). Close and Exit Rosetta Stone at this point.<br />3. I found the language files in the Rosetta Stone TOTALe mounted disk image that should have been mounted in your system as part of the install process, or you can look in the Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 for Mac  (Download) folder in your downloads folder and click on the RSItalianLevel1.dmg file to mount it . You can click on the Rosetta Stone TOTALe mounted disk image and see its contents- copy the file that ends in &#34;.rsd&#34;  (in my case the file name was &#34;SK-ITA-L1-NA-PE-NA-NA-Y-3.7.5.2.r2.rsd&#34;) .  Per the other directions, you can also find the &#34;language level file at Macintosh HD, Library, Application Support, Rosetta Stone, TOTALe.&#34;<br />2. Next, click into the following folders: Macintosh HD, Library, Application Support, Rosetta Stone, Language Training, AutoInstall (if you have Rosetta Stone Language Learning) Note: If you do not see a folder named AutoInstall, just right click in the white space and click New Folder from the menu that appears. You'll then be able to name it AutoInstall.  (I did not have the AutoInstall file and had to create it)<br />3.  Paste the .rsd file you copied in step one into the AutoInstall folder.<br />4. Now open Rosetta Stone and you should see a message saying &#34;Installing Languages&#34;.<br />5. It should be working now.have the AutoInstall file and had to create it)<br />3.

So there is that. OTOH, I could not argue with the price ($25), so one gets what one pays for.<br /><br />I am a huge ABBYY user. Most of the work I do is conversion of scans & PDFs back to their original format. ABBYY does well with this and I am used to the interface. Omnipage was the previous Gold Standard of OCR, so it has some weight. However, it appears the Nuance Company has shifted their focus to other products and Omnipage suffered. Along with that, there is a newer version of Omnipage out there.<br /><br />Overall, I am glad I have the software. I am sure I will find use for it. However, had it not been offered at such a bargain basement cost, I doubt I would have purchased it. The interface is not all that intuitive and one is locked into using Internet Explorer as a browser that communicates with the software (no Chrome, Firefox, Opera etc). I guess with quite a bit of effort, I will make it work, but out of the box, it was confusing.<br /><br />Also, Nuance Tech Support pretty much stinks......unless you pay for it. Just finding an update for the software was an all day affair.<br /><br />A solid &#34;Meh&#34;.<br /><br />Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.	2015-07-28

Adobe Photoshop has been the most reliable software I've ever used, up until the 'Creative Cloud' and their new iterative release cycle.  My experience with Photoshop CC has been poor, and this once vaunted name has been tainted with slow performance, random application crashes, and bugs.  Bugs everywhere.<br /><br />You have to contact Adobe's customer service to cancel an annual subscription, so the rep has a chance to talk you into more 'deals' and 'savings', all the while trying to sell you into staying with the product.  It's aggravating, to say the least, but on top of all of that, Adobe will charge you 50% of your remaining subscription for an early termination.  Their archaic methods makes me question the company as a whole, and I will reconsider any future products or services from Adobe.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and find a copy of Photoshop CS6, where you won't have to pay a monthly fee for a buggy application.	2015-07-27

I converted from Windows to Mac this year and would have liked to have kept my financial data.  It didn't occur to me that this could be such a problematic program, so I bought it.  I followed on-line instructions to convert the Windows file to a Mac file again and again without success.  Finally, I called Intuit, only to be told that there is no way to convert Quicken for Windows 2013 to Mac by yourself.  Instead you must upload your file to a &#34;secure&#34; website.  Although I was reassured by the Intuit agent that doing so would be completely secure, I was hesitant because, what else would they say?  At any rate, I did it because I do want to completely switch to a Mac platform.  I checked back for weeks, wrote e-mails to the support team, and the file was never converted and returned to me.  After about a month or more, I decided I just had to move on and so I recreated the accounts and downloaded all of the available data.  After entering 18 months worth of data, such as payee and category, for a dozen accounts, I found that I I could not reconcile the accounts.  After checking the monthly balance with the statement, Quicken still insisted that it had to be adjusted as it did not jive with the ending balance of the monthly statement, despite the fact that it did.  I called Intuit for a refund and they said it had been more than 60 days.  Based on the reviews, I'm going to try iBank free for 30 days.  I would advise anyone who is contemplating switching from Quicken Windows to the Mac version to reconsider.	2015-07-27

The past several years I've used the Internet Security product which allowed me to obtain a 3 user license and I could always find a good price on this product.  Now I note that Internet Security has become Security and the smallest license I could find, greater than a single user license has now become 5 users.  I was not surprised to see the price has increased and I paid more money than I needed because a 3 user license was just fine for me.  This is a good product but Norton, like many of the other software companies always finds a means to charge me more.  What's wrong with a discount for being a loyal customer?	2015-07-27

Years ago my recipes were out of control and I search and found Cook'n.  I have paid for upgrades a couple of times during this time. But, found purchasing their upgrades was rarely needed. Sometimes I was able to just download the upgrades.  This is the place I store and manage and find all of my recipes.  There is a great search engine to help with the finding part. I used tech support to be able to use their cloud feature. There were some glitches. Now I have access to my recipes anywhere I go on my iPad which I love.  The snipit tool to continue to add to my recipes works with what may be considered a work around.  I copy and paste into the snipit tool. Then adding my recipes are easy.  You can purchase cook books through Cook'n.  They are easily integrated.  I find that I just search and find my own recipes and then upload them myself.	2015-07-27

I've very happily upgraded to the download.  I like the ease of entering my own recipes, as well as the many ways to sort and search for recipes on file.  My one concern used to be what would happen to the thousands of recipes i had entered if my computer died.  With the latest Cookn editions, all my recipes are saved on the cloud. Even better, they are accessible from my mobile devices as well as my desktop.  I love that I can automatically import recipes I've pinned on Pinterest.  I can also easily import any recipe I find on the web.  It really couldn't get simpler.  The clincher for me is the great customer service.  Whenever I've run into glitches with updates, the DVO team has always replied quickly and given me whatever information I needed to get the software working again.  I really love this aspect of Cookn.	2015-07-27

Know what you are getting because the standard $49 package does not have the timeline controls and 3D features that you really need for animation.  This Pro version costs more but does have better features and more content.  There is a learning curve.  You won't  be making feature movies in half an hour as some of the tutorials might suggest if you are new to this type of software.  The on-line tutorials don't bother to tell you they are using the Pipeline version of Crazytalk, the most expensive version of the 3.  Standard, Pro and Pipeline.  There's I-Clone too but that's another higher catagory.  When your watching YouTube tutorials be sure to look on the top bar left or right depending if you're using Mac or PC by the X / minimize bar.  This will show you what version they are using.  If they are using Pipeline you won't be able to perform some of the features that they are doing and it's disappointing. I felt a little bit deceived. That's why I'm only giving 3 stars although I should probably give it one more. It is fun to use.	2015-07-27

It takes me far more time to use Dragon Dictate than to just type.<br /><br />Frankly, this software is so buggy it is worthless.  If it worked like it was supposed it, would be great.  It reminded me of software you would get in the early 90s.  Awkward, buggy, difficult to use, does whatever it wants instead of what you tell it.

And when I called USAA technical support, they said they didn't support AceMoney and suggested Quicken. But after trying Quicken for a little while, I decided that I liked the user interface on AceMoney much better. It was much more intuitive, and I was able to find what I wanted to do considerably faster because I didn't need to drill down through multiple levels of menus. So I went back to AceMoney, looked through their support forums, and was able to get it running with the my USAA accounts. Since I'd already purchased this Quicken, I left it installed side by side with AceMoney in case I ultimately found something that Quicken could do that AceMoney couldn't. But after several months of use, I've yet to find anything to drive me to try Quicken again.	2015-07-26

This is the third year in a row that I have purchased a Norton subscription. Prior to Norton, I always bough McAfee Security products but the student pricing convinced me to purchase Norton. I have continued to purchase Norton security products since as they work great on all of my devices. I have Macs and PCs and it is great that my subscription easily works on all of them. It is an easy to use software that also has an attractive interface. I have never had virus or malware problems on any of my computers since getting Norton installed. The only concern I have is that the firewall can sometimes make it difficult to connect to my network attached devices, but it is pretty easy to change the settings to fix the problem.	2015-07-26

Do not buy this.<br /><br />I identified a bug in their Missouri STATE software that would have had me paying out 900 dollars to Missouri, instead of collecting 300.  The software would not apply the credit I receive for paying Kansas taxes.  (My wife and i both live in Missouri, and work in Kansas).<br /><br />I spent about 6 hours on the line with their tier 2 support before they finally asked me to discontinue using the state software, then print out and file my own state taxes.  No refund was offered.  I have the case number if anyone is interested.	2015-07-26

The product worked fine, but like so many I was forced to upgrade to Deluxe from Basic to get schedule D. After hearing the CEO of Intuit say they would refund $25.00 with an apology I looked to follow up on the offer. I went to their web site but could not get it to work as it demanded a higher upgrade than I got and more than the CEO said was required. So, I spent about 2 hours on the internet to find a phone number I could call to apply for the refund. It doesn't matter now what it was as you only had until the end of April to apply and it was a 3rd party number working for them which is no longer valid. Long story short, I did successfully apply (it took a while as the guy I got wasn't sure how to do it) and received an e-mail saying I would get a check in 4-8 weeks. After 10 weeks and nothing, I realized that I would have to take it another step. Rather than getting some customer service person who knew nothing about this and had no power, I wrote to the CEO directly (found on the internet), with a copy of the email, explaining the situation. About 10 days later (including the fourth of July weekend) I got an email from the VP of Intuit explaining that the 3rd party person I dealt with did not submit my paperwork properly. He promised a check which I got about a week later.<br />So, if you applied and never got a check and you have proof (the email from intuit saying you had a check coming), that is the way to get your money.	2015-07-26

Wondershare has designed the program to match the user interface of the most current Microsoft Office (Office 2013 at this writing) and it functions so flawlessly that others who've seen me use it have asked why their Office suite doesn't include PDF Element. If you work with Office, you already know how to use the common features of this software.<br /><br />My work requires me to send and receive several PDF documents a day; with PDF Element I'm able to make any needed edits or conversions quickly and easily.

I have been using Norton 360 since 2009 and never had a problem. I was unhappy to learn that there was only one more year for Norton 360 and it had been downgraded from the one I knew and trusted. Now for the product at hand. Do not install it unless you delete whatever Norton security that is on your computer or it will do it but it will lengthen your install by about an hour. The install itself is pretty straight forward. and I have installed it on four computers, one each of Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Saw no real difference in the installs and it works well on all. I can not comment directly on whether as some have said it takes less resources and your computer in turn runs faster. Mine does, but I made other changes at about the same time. Due to this I can not say whether it was totally Norton. Like all Norton products, it goes about its business and protects your computer. I have it set up to automatically scan the computer which I never did before and it seems to work well. Unlike Norton 360 which told you when it last updated the virus definitions, it only tells you they are up to date or not. I had to call Norton to find this out as it is not obvious at least to me. You loose the ability to do Registry cleanup which was great after you deleted a program. Everyone who buys this product should complain to Norton, maybe they might put it back as it should be. The best thing is that it can be used on any wired or wireless product you have.	2015-07-26

In 2014 I paid $29.99 to upgrade to iBank 5 on my Mac, and also purchased the iPhone version for $9.99. I paid another $9.99 early in 2015 to upgrade the iPhone version, and at some point I also paid $19.99 for the iPad version. I like to have apps synced across my all Apple devices, though this is the most I've ever paid to do so by far.   I also paid $39.99 for a year of &#34;Direct Access,&#34; an iBank service that links to your banks and cards to iBank to auto-update your information. Almost immediately there were issues with Direct Access mis-categorizing transactions and registering transfers between accounts within my iBank document very awkwardly, with duplications and redundancies.  The worst thing was that within a couple of weeks of Direct Access updates, the balances showed by iBank were always different than the correct ones listed by the banks and cards themselves. Customer service couldn't figure this out and recommended that I manually enter a &#34;balance adjustment&#34; in my ledger (i.e. a transaction that never actually happened, adding or subtracting the difference between what iBank was showing and what my banks were showing). I tried this but the inconsistencies re-emerged shortly after... so I never actually had the accurate balances reflected in iBank.  In April 2015, I tried to link my PayPal to iBank with Direct Access and got a strange gobbledygook error message. So I contacted customer support again. After 15 minutes or so the rep couldn't figure it out so he said he would look into it and get back to me. I asked for a very general estimate of when I could expect a follow-up contact from him and he was extremely evasive and so, against my better judgment, I let it go.  Almost three weeks later, with no response, I followed up and got a different rep who said she would find out what was going on and get back to me, though also was cagey about a timeframe. This was around two months ago and no one has ever replied to me about how to connect one of my important accounts for personal and business expenses to the Direct Access that I am paying for (and doesn't work that well to begin with).  This is the deal-breaker for me. Buggy software is one thing, but it's another when the company seems not to care about addressing my concerns. So maybe iGG customer support did me a favor by finally motivating me to ditch iBank by (as far as I can tell) ignoring my issue while telling me they were investigating it.  At any rate, the bottom line is that after nearly two years of bearing with this poorly-executed app that offers few if any unique benefits over its competition, drains away my time dealing with customer service's indifferent attempts to solve its myriad problems, and is constantly picking my pocket with new charges when they roll out new versions and features, I'm deleting the software and going back to the free and more competently programmed and managed Mint.com.	2015-07-25

Horrible step backward and worst user interface - Keep your older version.	I recently Downgraded from VISIO 2010 (which was a downgrade from VISIO 2007) because the company is moving to Office 2013.  Not only did they fail to fix interface issues, and the most stupid paste behavior ever conceived, they made the look of 2013 difficult to discern the icons and buttons.  They all fade in with the background.  Why M$ insists on the Fisher Price scheme with garish colors for Windows 8 (and for 10 it appears) but eliminates colors almost altogether for gray icons and buttons is beyond me.  I hate this version.  HATE IT!  I have been using VISIO since before M$ bought the company.  This is the worst version EVER.	2015-07-24

Put your local computer guy out of a job. I'm not kidding. Most of the computers I work on are so &#34;jacked&#34; up with garbage that a factory hard drive restore is necessary, just to get a stable system. Next step is to install Norton. There is no program that is bulletproof but Norton comes close. Yes, previous versions have taken up system resources but compared to other companies Norton provides the best overall system  protection available. The internet is like the old west, an open frontier that can be hazardous. Norton is easy to install, maintain, and is capable of running in the background with little or no user input. Norton will protect you and save you money. You get ten devices, they can be computers, tablets, phones, or any combination. Devices can be managed by logging into &#34;Manage Devices.&#34; You can delete a device and get back the license for that device, allowing you to install on another device as many times needed. You just can't have more than ten active devices at once. Your computer guy will thank you and I thank you. Please click yes if this helps, thanks. JJ	2015-07-24

I was using an earlier version of this program and had some problems and contacted their tech support team. These people are fabulous! They stay in touch and are very honest about your issues. I decided to take a chance at upgrading to the new version and it has features beyond what I expected.<br />First of all, I am the keeper of the family recipes. Some of these are very old and I couldn't figure out how to digitize and save them so I was loading them in Word. This program will capture them from a scan and even keeps a copy of the original. It's so incredible to read Mom's recipes in her handwriting on my computer! I can surf the net and download recipes into the program and for ONCE!!! everything is in one place. I no longer have a little cookbook on every site with a few recipes in it.<br />If you're a cook, or a baker, or just like to think that &#34;you'd like to make that someday&#34;, this software is really what works.

Don't get me wrong, I use Amazon frequently and like their service and a loyal TurboTax user for 20+ years. But I will not buy someone else's software through Amazon ever again. I mistakenly downloaded the WIN version rather than the MAC version when I purchased TurboTax 2014 Premier through Amazon. Amazon and Intuit both say they stand behind their products, but read on before you buy downloadables. I do not own a Windows computer so the software was no use to me. Amazon said I had to seek a refund from TurboTax since there is no physical disk to return to them. I did so, filing a claim after following TurboTax's hard to find claim procedures. After about three months with NO REPLY from TurboTax, I tried to call them. (Good luck trying to find an actual phone number to call.) I followed all their instructions and submitted my claim again, which I was told has to be reviewed by a &#34;team&#34; of reviewers to determine whether my claim was legitimate. For about three more months, I heard nothing from TurboTax, so I sent monthly follow up emails reminding them they are supposed to be considering my claim and repeating the details of my claim. Nothing. And this is on the heels of the fiasco last year with TurboTax pricing that caused many loyal customers to jump ship. Then, finally, an email saying that if my claim is approved, I can expect a refund check in the mail in 8-12 weeks. That was about 3 months ago. Not a word, not a check. Nothing. I can only conclude that Intuit is not a reputable company. I am also disappointed in Amazon, which seems not to have figured out how to provide customer service for digital download products.	2015-07-24

That said, Intuit customer service is nonexistant.  So if you are not really software savvy, I mean really certified in usage of several software programs you will have a learning curve when using this software.  This package assumes you have at least a midrange skillset with software.<br /><br />The program has had very few issues, I use it to the fullest. Actually some of my clients prefer this package so it is one of the several I use to assist them in their record keeping.  It has been so adaptable that several clients with over twenty rentals, other businesses on the side as well as other incomes generated are easily kept current of where they stand.  It is easy to view balance sheets, EOY, Assests/Liabilities, Stocks,Sales Tax, Property Tax, Business Taxes and  Annual tax information as well.  Setup does take some time for each new client who prefers this product as they are smaller scale, but it is well worth it in ease of use.<br /><br />For those with issues, perhaps you could take a class on setup and usage in varous software programs.  When you become certified in four or more packages you will find new confidence, fewer issues as well as a new joy in resolving work related issues.	2015-07-24

However, being forced to upgrade by the threat of removing that addiction is just plain old blackmail.  To add insult to injury, the program keeps getting worse.  Loaded with features your average user won't ever use, and your power users will discover are broken, these releases become more buggy every year.  Not to mention the shear anxiety that now accompanies every use.  At one point, all my downloads went to &#34;temp accounts&#34; and some came up with data that just wasn't right.  I had to put the whole thing aside and work on it when I felt up to corrupting 30 years worth of data (yes, I keep backups - I just hate having to go through data restores - don't trust the whole process and I have 25 years in IT).  If I could have stayed with the 20xx version I would have.  I'm guessing the whole personal finance software business is kind of a loser since they couldn't seem to care less about a product which was once the flagship of their organization....	2015-07-24

We've been using Quicken ever since it printed dot-matrix checks on a PC-XT, some time in the 1980's or early 90's.<br />I've worked in IT for about the same length of time, so I'm fairly knowledgeable about computers.<br />We were forced to \\"upgrade\\" to Quicken 2015 because our old computer died suddenly and all of our banking and bill paying was based on Quicken 2013, which worked.<br />I did a new install on a brand new Windows computer.  I had a current backup of our last Quicken file from the old computer.<br /><br />I don't know where to start.<br /><br />Quicken corrupted the data file including our payee list. Repeated attempts reload the file from backup failed, and the various data validation and fix programs suggested by the \\"help\\" personnel did nothing.<br /><br />Despite working with our very helpful bank people several times, Quicken 2015 insists that the bank is \\"blocking\\" Quicken and it cannot connect.  Bank personnel have checked everything at their end, and they insist that they are not blocking anything.<br /><br />We cannot send a payment to anyone using Quicken 2015.<br /><br />We've had a number of very frustrating 1 hour sessions over the last two weeks and the expensive program can't perform a single one of the simplest banking functions.<br /><br />It can't keep track of our balance, and it can't send a check.<br />I have no idea whether its advanced investment functions work, and I don't care.<br /><br />I'd like to see Quicken produce a \\"Quicken Simpleton\\" edition that just works the way it did 10 years ago.<br /><br />Oh, almost forgot.  I've tried the Chat line several times. I won't reproduce the conversation here, but several other people have and you should read those.  I'm not even sure that you're \\"chatting\\" with a human being.  The responses sound like a computer, or maybe a person rigidly reciting a script. They suggest the same thing over and over and when that doesn't work they suggest it again.  And they waste time saying \\"I understand that must be very frustrating.\\" and \\"I'm very glad you have come to talk to us.\\" and \\"Is it OK if we do that now?\\"<br /><br />You send them a description of your problem at the beginning of the session, and they either do not or can not read it.<br /><br />They are neither experts in the program, nor, I suspect, native speakers of English.<br /><br />So. The program is worthless and useless, riddled with bugs so it can't perform the most basic functions.  There is no useful support from the company. They've got your cash, so they don't care.<br /><br />A complete waste of money. We are looking into our bank's free bill pay service, and our 20 year relationship with Quicken is over.	2015-07-23

I have used Norton for nearly 20 years.  I was appalled that the device installation REQUIERED I use Google to install it!  One of the reasons I USE security is to protect me from mass marketing and miss-use of my data. NOT to require me to sign up for it!  The installation on my workstations works fine. I just upgraded to Fire Phone, so it is impossible to use Google install. A waste and a disappointment. I would have thought that Norton could support a download from their own website. What a shame for a once great company.	2015-07-23

With respect to the entire first CD and (so far) part of the second CD, the material in version 4 is EXACTLY THE SAME as that in version 3! Doing a side-by-side comparison, one can see a picture here or there has changed. The only real difference is the order in which material is presented. Version 4 skips a lot, making it seem less repetitive. A few weeks or months later, version 4 will ask you to complete the skipped material as an &#34;adaptive recall.&#34; Sadly, that's about all that was done...

Can't say I had any virus problems for my one year.  :However, once your time is up you will see that it spikes your CPU usage on your computer to the point that the computer locks up until it is able to display its ad saying if you renew you will get 50% off.  I clicked on this so that I could renew only to be sent to a website that wanted me to buy multiple licenses and a higher level of coverage.  I started a chat with a &#34;product specialist&#34; how wanted my phone number then they wanted to call me to &#34;make sure I received the best level of coverage&#34;  I explained that I knew what I wanted and I only wanted one license still they wanted to call.  I declined and again stated I knew what product I wanted and how many licenses I needed and just wanted to know about where to purchase that and get the 50% off.  After 30 minutes or more of a back and forth conversation where they insisted on asking me some question about my needs they disconnected the chat.  So basically they realized I wasn't buy more and left.  The next day I tried again and when through much the same only to be told the 1 year 1 license would cost me around $60 and that was with the 50% off.  I will never buy their product again.  This year I switched to Bitdefender.  They are ranked higher anyway.	2015-07-23

However, starting a few weeks ago I was having weird issues with my PC where I was unable to connect to the internet.  I wasn't able to access the network and sharing center either.  I search around, via my phone, but wasn't able to easily determine the issue.  I decided to do a system restore but when I clicked the icon, it wouldn't open!  So I went into safe mode and did a system restore from there; followed by a complete system scan.  Everything seemed fine for about a week until it happened again.  Same thing, did a system restore in safe mode and an even more thorough scan.  Everything was good for about a week or two and again, unable to connect to internet.  At this point, I suspected Avast may be the issue.  I went to msconfig to try and stop it from booting on startup, but it wouldn't let me!  I booted into safe mode and disabled it from there and restarted.  Upon startup, I was logging into the internet.  After reading several RECENT negative reviews on the product, I decided to remove.  The last few weeks have been frustrating and I hope that Avast can work to improve their product.  But for now, I look elsewhere for internet security.	2015-07-23

So, I went ahead and scheduled for 9 to 11 am Friday. When I got<br />off the phone I was disappointed that I couldn't get the windows 8.1 pro<br />pack installed. But, I kept thinking about it and went on line and found a<br />few reviews of people that have had the same problem with it saying that<br />the product key was good but, the program say that there was a problem and<br />to contact the website for support. Then I found a review that one customer<br />had the same problem but, he was able to uninstall the Mcafee anti-virus<br />and tried it again and the 8.1 pro pack installed fine. So, I decided to<br />give it a try. I uninstalled my McAfee All-access security program and<br />followed the instructions that I printed for the product key and low and<br />behold it worked. Everything installed like it was supposed to. And, I<br />reinstalled McAfee security and activated my Windows 8.1 Pro with Media<br />Center. Evidently, the security program wouldn't let me upgrade without<br />uninstalling it first.	2015-07-23

There have been a couple of glitches, but the staff is extremely responsive and answer the same day.  They are also always updating their editions to fix problems.  Entering recipes is a pain, but it is going to be so.  I have collected cut-out recipes for 25 years and pasted them into 2 large books.  I tried the scanning method to enter them, but that is nearly as time-consuming as entering them by hand...  I have made changes over the years or I like to give different instructions than those written.  So it took me several weeks to enter my 400+ recipes.  I now have a copy of the program on my Envy tablet-PC (couldn't easily find this, so the help desk at DVO sent me a link) and also the app on my android phone.  It is super handy to be able to look up the ingredients of a certain recipe right on my phone while at the grocery or just at home making up menus.  It is also easy to read from the tablet or phone while preparing the recipes in the kitchen.  I have not had problems w/ the app crashing, except at first on my husband's IPad.  It eventually worked, and no problems since.  The main difficulty is syncing between all of those devices when I add new recipes.  It can be done.  I have found I need to close the desktop version so that it saves and backs up.  Then I close all of my apps on other devices.  Then open the desktop and press the cloud-shaped sync button.  Then open each app and press the sync.  After all that, the recipes are all in the same places.  But considering I don't intend to enter a bunch of new recipes in the future, this is not a bad procedure.  I have tried the menu planning and grocery list process.  The instructions online are quite confusing.  But once it gets going, this is a very handy feature.  I have been writing menus and grocery lists by hand for years, so this will be helpful.  The only complaint is that the 'pantry' items like spices are listed on the grocery list....  It would be super handy if you could mark off things you have on hand so that they would not appear in the list.  My other suggestion would be that when entering recipes that some common instructions would somehow be available as drop-downs or something.  I had to type 'minced' 'chopped' 'softened' so many times that it drove me crazy.  Overall, it is a great product.  It is worth the investment of time and money.  If you have problems, contact the DVO people; they are great!	2015-07-23

This isn't a video capture card; it's much more. If you can get the video/photos/sound thru your computer to your monitor, Screen Capture can put it on a hard drive, big thumb drive, or &#34;the Cloud&#34; for you.You have old VHS tapes you want on a media server? You can &#34;get there from here&#34;, most easily thru a Wi-Fi connected AVR. &#34;Copyguarded&#34;? Don't worry, what you see on the screen of your monitor is what you'll record. Want to record from Amazon Prime or Netflix(tm), or the &#34;encrypted&#34; sources like Vudu(tm) ? Stream them to your computer, and pick them off the screen in 4K if you want to (BIG files!), then you can burn them to H.264/Blu-Ray, or keep them on the bargain USB 3.0 terabyte drives available. You are doing this for your our PERSONAL use and NOT to circumvent any legal agreements to the otherwise. (Lawyer-speak.) I gave it 4 stars as there's no 4.5. There is SOME generational loss from the source to the file, which is an aggregate of video artifacts you won't get around from every source without spending $2500 or up on hardware/software. On a 46&#34; class &#34;2K&#34; upverting SONY(tm) Bravia from a viewing distance of about 8 feet, from an &#34;HDX&#34; source (a little better than Blu-Ray), the file streamed via my media center (20 gig, 2 hour movie) only shows some time base error artifacts. The picture is not QUITE as good as a good commercial Blu-Ray disc. I've worked in professional video since 1968 with 1/2&#34; reel-to-reel black&white video (PORTABLE!) and with the old 2&#34; broadcast recorders and digital now. I'm super-picky. It's more than worth the money to me. You can learn to use it like a pro in an evening.	2015-07-22

The score reflects the frustration I experienced in renewing my coverage, and the horrible customer experience I had with their tech support.<br /><br />I have purchased the software through Amn for several years, because Norton always wanted to charge considerably more.  But Norton has now made it very difficult to install a new version when you have a prior version.  The worst part came when I decided to call the Tech support number on the page that would keep popping up whenever I did anything on the Norton site:  Instant Tech Expert.  I was expecting a simple help desk call, with the tech just telling me how to find the screen where I could input the product code for my new software.  Instead I got a tech who wanted to get background info, like my name, address, phone number.  At that point I refused to provide any more personal information so he moved on to actually asking about my problem.  He said that he could take control of my PC and help me directly.  And that was fine, I followed the instructions and loaded the iYogi software and gave him permission to take control.<br /><br />But rather than helping me with the screen navigation he proceeded to explore and check out the software stack, because something might be conflicting with Norton.  And of course, he found software installed, ASK.com, that can be a problem.  He had to query every title (what is this Quicken, did you install it?) until I got a little testy and he moved on to asking to run a diagnostic, part of the iYogi platform.  It found registry errors, the Ask.com software.  &#34;This is very bad, it needs to be fixed&#34;.  And of course, they could do that for me, for a price.<br /><br />At that point, knowing that there are always registry errors, and he couldn't tell me anything more about them, and remembering that the Ask.com came when I was updating Java, but I never enabled it, I decided that this was bogus.  I askedif he was going drop this and help me install Norton , as I had been asking about every 5 minutes, and he said that it shouldn't be done until the security problems had been remediated.  Actually, we went around in circles for about 5 minutes, me saying we were done, just install Norton, and he saying in various ways that he wasn't going to do that without the fixes being done first.  I told him to remove iYogi, which he did.  And I ended the call.  After 45 wasted minutes.<br /><br />I looked up iYogi later and the outfit was seen as legitimate tech support by some reviewers, just not very competent and focused on &#34;upselling&#34; (that cleansing service I refused).  Others called them scammers. But at least no one said that they drop Trojans without you knowing it.<br /><br />2 hours later, when I had a few minutes, I tried again on my own.  I started by creating a new account on the Norton site, rather than trying to use my existing one, and in a few minutes figured out how to input the key, download the new software, remove the old, and I was done.  So I'm using the software I bought from Amazon.  I should have had a little more patience.  But no thanks to Norton - one of the worst customer experiences I've ever had.  Next year I'm shifting to a different product.	2015-07-22

It's a very powerful system for animating or just drawing.  Once you get the hang of it, animating is fun and I can't imagine can be made much easier.  Some people apparently want to be able to make a cartoon in five or six clicks of a mouse - although it is a probably as close as you can come to it!  This software is designed as an intro to creating powerful custom animation.<br /><br />No powerful software comes without a steep learning curve.  It does have a 'beginners' mode.'  If you want to buy this software and use it be prepared to spend a lot of time and then you will find its value.<br /><br /> But:<br />Their support system stinks.  Even after registering they won't give me the debugged upgrade to 10.3(or whatever it is and still be 10) - When I click update in their menu they give me window saying...&#34;BUY version 11! - only ----- dollars.&#34;  That's bizarre - I've never seen a company make just an upgrade of a current version so difficult.  Most companies WANT you to have the best possible version of what you paid for.  Just getting signed into their support boards and registering the software was huge hassle.<br /><br />Help is limited to online support boards which only have answers to complex esoteric things and are not designed for people starting.<br /> Usually you can look on the internet for support for common software, especially games, but this is too esoteric to find little things.  You can find videos on it on YouTube.<br /><br />So the company that makes/sells this, Smith Micro... leave a lot to be desired in support.  But the software itself is excellent, once you figure out how to use it.	2015-07-22

Many of us fell in love with Windows XP Pro when it first came out. The versions of windows after XP were crap and no one I know had much luck with them. Apple's best friend was later versions of Windows. I did not want to upgrade for this reason. When I saw the &#34;Big Guy&#34; on the T.V. a little over a year ago I thought; Now there is an AMERICAN company that may help me keep my XP. I was currently using AVG and it was O.K. but I would occasionally have a glitch with it. Since I switched to PC Matic, I have had absolutely no glitches, my computer runs great, and I have set up two other computers with the protection. The $ 50.00 per year is well worth it. Having that peace of mind is very important. It is re-assuring to know your covered from the nasties on the internet these days. Plus, it's made in America, and that alone makes me happy! I don't know why everyone trusts companies from other countries, most of the bad malware and viruses come from these same countries, go figure!! That's why I gave PC Matic a five star rating; Because it deserves it!	2015-07-22

It has has some bugs, but you will never find better customer service than this company. Once when I was having problems the owner of the company called me personally and helped me figure it out. Who does that, he spent a good amount of time with me working out the problem. I have printed one cookbook for all of my children for Christmas a few years back and plan on doing another one this year. I love the way that my laptop, i-pad and i-phone work with the cookin' cloud. I have my recipes where ever I go. I love being able to email them to my family and friends at the drop of a hat. They never stop improving it, and work very hard to do anything for their customers. I also have to add, that it is very simple to use, and the live recipe feed is so very cool!!	2015-07-22

It always does a good job with the things that I need it to do.  I gave the latest release 4 stars because I seem to be having trouble keeping my bank accounts tied-in for automatic updates.  I've had to reset the on-line accounts several times on different accounts because they had stopped updating on-line.  That said everything else works well and the mobile app seems to do a pretty good job as well.<br /><br />I would suggest a cloud file storage system that would allow you to access/use Quicken on multiple computers depending on where you are.  It would be nice to be able to work from my laptop at home, work computer at work and/or have my wife use her laptop to get in and add bills, pay bills, etc.  Best way to do this would be using the cloud.  I actually use iCloud to host my working file and so far it seems to work OK but I know Quicken does not recommend this and several glitches I've experienced could be a result of trying to use iCloud for my working files.	2015-07-22

You still can't pay bills directly through the program, but updating is easier than in Windows, and a lot faster. I find it easier to edit and use split transactions. Missing: auto backup and &#34;copy transaction.&#34; I do miss those, but if you use a Mac, you might find the rest of the program to be better.<br /><br />I'm retired, so I no longer need a lot of features, just lists of deposits and expenditures, balances. It does this fine. I can't pay my bills through Quicken, but I like paying them through the bank website better anyway. However, Quicken for Mac does not present a list of downloaded transactions for me to review and modify. This is the worst part for me, along with the fact that I can not download Regions Bank transactions with the Mac version like I could with the Windows version. However, not having to go to Windows to use Quicken is a major benefit for me, so I'm using it. It is definitely an ugly stepchild though.	2015-07-21

In the time I have spent changing numerous settings--turning off firewalls, turning off updates, turning off screensavers, turning off power options, turning off antivirus software, and thus making my computers completely vulnerable--plus calling a call centre in India and then talking to someone in North America--I could have downloaded most of my programs.<br /><br />And this aggravation cost me sixty bucks!	2015-07-21

It's sad that you (Amazon) have done away with the sync feature in your cloud drive in the manner you have done so. It's worrying that it appears that the governance of Amazon show a lack of concern for those who have used your service and have placed their trust in you to keep safe what could be quite important files.  It begs the question - if that's your mindset, what will you do next to your users detriment?  We know its free of cost for most, but you must understand that you still have a responsibility. With that statement, I hope you will not consider pulling the plug on your service so people lose their files.  It's a worry and I'm not prepared to take risks with my files so I shall cease using your service asap.	2015-07-21

This is the worst version yet.  It downloaded a bunch of stock splits that I now can't get rid of.  They don't match reality and no matter what I do I can't get rid of them.  I also loose connections to my online financial accounts, different ones every time, probably two or there a week.  Their &#34;FIX&#34; either locks up my computer or just doesn't work!  So I do it manually.  It would also be nice if you could export out of quicken into a fresh quicken file.  Example:  I wanted to separate out my son's brokerage and savings account into a new file.  You can export into a CSV but good luck mapping the fields when you try to import them into the new file.  I tried copying the file and deleting the accounts I didn't want but then I had all these Ghost accounts that I couldn't find to delete.  I finally had to start from scratch and lost all the history and now have to go to a backup of the original.  Online help is useless, basically reinstall.  Don't bother it doesn't help!  This is probably a good application if you have limited data and limited history.  Did I mention the reports are horrible and tedious if you want to customize.	2015-07-21

The formatted resume cannot be saved, however you can save (I think it was called) the &#34;electronic&#34; format. It is not a format that would be given to a possible employer but would at least save the resume information for future use. My suggestion is to have all information and resume paper on hand so that you do not waste time searching. Some of the job suggested script is a little hokey and unrealistic. All in all, it will provide many (40 I think) resume formats and a cover letter on the trial version. I would not pay over $15 for this.

Panda Free Antivirus 2015 was just rated the BEST free antivirus by PC Magazine, and several impartial Information Technology testers on YouTube!  Detection and elimination rates are very high, and in some cases, perfect!  I have also read that this cloud-based Panda product outperforms many commercial antivirus software suites that one has to pay for!  In my specific case, I was getting sick and tired of paying a rapacious yearly renewal fee for my Norton360 antivirus (about 90 dollars!), when it was available online for much less!  One would thank that Symantec would charge a steady, loyal customer less for their product, not more.  So I removed (cancelled) Norton360 from 3 of my PC's, and installed Panda Free Antivirus 2015 on them.  I also continue to use Malwarebytes (a free anti-malware, anti-spyware software) as a second line of defense (I do periodic scans), and I have had no issues or infections.  Panda Free Antivirus 2015 is a highly effective, proven, free antivirus package, scans quickly, has a good simple interface, and is light on your PC's resources.  In short, it's perfect!	2015-07-20

I am thoroughly fed up and disgusted with the slavery and greed that Adobe has turned to. Yes they have lots of schools biting the huge $$ bullet and still buying (now by the seat, not user) and some large design corps that want to use it, but the smaller colleges (like the one I worked for) cannot afford the money it costs without great sacrifice!<br />Not only that, but small time designers like me are left out in the cold, dark world of searching for an alternative. But search we must, as I refuse to bow down to their model of indentureship-(pay monthly or you don't get to use it!!).<br />No thanks Adobe. I tweeted when you announced this horrible, non-thinking of your loyal users- attitude that you just put a noose around your neck. If Corel would wake up and Xara steps up to the plate, anyone could create a Dreamweaver clone and we would buy it in droves.

I then called the quicken help line and after three hours working with them (including uninstalling the program twice, once with quicken's ultra clean method) we were left with where we started. The lady on the helpline at the end was really honest when she said &#34;I guess Quicken 2015 does not work with Windows 7 and / or Quicken 12&#34;.

And forget actually adding music, because when you do Movavi starts playing the music WHERE YOU DIDN'T EVEN PUT IT! But don't worry, if you only play that clip individually there is no unnecessary music. And unless you LOVE shutting down your computer because it freezes your screen and you can't close out so you have to restart EVERYTHING then you won't find the software helpful.

The one big flaw in this typing program for me is the virtual keyboard. Users should have the option to hide the virtual keyboard when practicing lessons.

If a user is slow to press the appropriate key then the virtual keyboard shows on the screen which key should be pressed.

I am not a IT professional. I have bought and used IOLO products for several years and have never had any issues with them as I did with the two largest companies. This is about as &#34;hands-off&#34; as any program can be and does not slow down my oldest computers.<br /> Yes, I reccomend this product and company based upon my experience. They put out a self running product that is far superior to the big brands that start with the letter &#34;N&#34; (the sewer worker) and &#34;Mc&#34;, both of which severely throttled my crappy computers. IOLO works seamlessly with the fast workstation boxes that we use in engineering and CAD/CAM.<br /> That is what matters to me. The IOLO was able to repair the mess that Art Carney and the Scottish name did on my boxes. For those that want a program that fixes and blocks problems; here you go.<br /> I have no connection to the company other than being a paying customer. I am only looking at the stuff again as my yearly subscription has expired.--------------- I suggest buying the full load as the System Mechanic portion cleans up your old buildup of trash. Besides, IOLO has never fouled up my wanted software.<br /> I hate the &#34;five-star&#34; review as there is always something wrong with any product. My complaint is that I don't get it for nothing; otherwise your experience will likely mirror mine. It is pretty nearly perfect in that it is completely effective so far, and it takes no maintenance input other than paying for it.	2015-07-19

I sent my email address FROM my phone TO the Norton site (there is a place under your account that says \\"add a device\\") and I had it up and running in no time.<br /><br />This software is not 100% proof against all malware--last year, I did get an infection from a very clever piece of malware that used a trick to get installed and the previous edition of the software did not recognize it as malware. I do not know if this update has improved its ability to detect everything--it's rated as very good for catching malware.	2015-07-19

The code didn't work.  I had to call the customer service, speak to someone from India about the problem.  She sent me an email with a link to tech support.  The tech support person, instead of giving me another code, took over my computer and entered a code for me... not the code I was given.  Then, since he had control of my computer, he ran the scan for me and changed settings on my computer.  He wanted me to enter the password for my email (I told him no- I didn't want to give him access to my email).  So now the program works on one computer.  I still have two more computers I was planning to install this program onto.  But I won't.  Because I would have to get ahold of tech support and give them access to my other computers.<br /><br />The program also changed settings on my computer that I'm unable to change back.  When I tried to do a system restore- shutting off anti-virus and firewalls- I was unable to.  I tried several times.  It seems my system restore does not work at all anymore.  This program also bogs down my computer- I had just installed a new hard drive a month prior to installing this and I do not have many programs on the computer.  Overall, this program is a waste of time and money.  They have shady tech support and customer service.  I'm not installing this on my other two computers.	2015-07-19

I have tried android apps from this developer and they were pretty weak.  That said, this program delivered what I expected.  It says right on the cover that it is for basic words and phrases.  It isn't fair to judge it harshly by saying it doesn't teach reading or writing.  The software never claimed to be anything more than a launching pad for the language.  For this purpose, it works fine.<br /><br />I travel to Cambodia every year, and I am familiar with the rules of the language.  There are many ways to address people with varying levels of respect.  The complexity of the honorific system in Khmer is much too complex for this basic program.  It also feels like they used the same phrases for all of their language programs, and then tried to fit Khmer phrases in to match.  This isn't always practical, and the result is that some of the phrases are strange.  For example, Khmer people just say &#34;choam reap sua&#34; or &#34;sua sdey&#34; for hello at any time of the day.  The program teaches &#34;good morning, good afternoon, and good evening&#34; - but all of these are very strange to say to a native speaker.  They are not wrong, but they are from a written tradition and very unusual in casual conversation.  I believe that Instant Immersion just teaches these three phrases in all of their programs.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-many words and phrases are useful and practical<br />-male and female voice for every word<br />-motivating progression system<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />-lazy execution - not individualized for learning Khmer<br />-some words and phrases are uncommon in the vernacular	2015-07-19

Simple things like this make it worth it.	2015-07-19

I loved Quicken when I first installed it and got it figured out - but the second banks made a security update, I lost all ability to download transactions, and it was more of a hassle than using a basic spreadsheet.  I contacted Quicken - and after several hours on the phone, was told to call my bank.  I called my bank, they said it had to be Quicken...  3 weeks later, I still cannot download transactions, and this product is just taking up space.	2015-07-19

I'm giving up and going back to the Windows version.  But I will give Intuit a little credit - Quicken for Mac 2015 (QM15) is a good step forward from Quicken Essentials for Mac (QEM) but still far behind their Windows counterparts.<br /><br />I have used Quicken for Windows since 2007 (I've used both the Deluxe and Premier versions). However, I have now drank the &quot;Apple-aid&quot; and converted to a MacBook in 2014.<br /><br />I tried QEM in 2014, but was extremely disappointed and frustrated that I did request a refund.<br /><br />However, Intuit made me an excellent officer for QM15, so I tried it.  It was good enough that i used QM15 for about six weeks.  But still, the frustrations and disappointments kept mounting so I reverted back to Q Deluxe for Windows 2013.<br /><br />Here are some of the gaps I noted:<br /><br />Bank account reckons need help.  Transactions that are not entered exactly in the method that the bank downloads them will create new transactions during the import process.  The Windows version will attempt (and does a remarkably good job at) matching the downloaded transactions with previously entered ones.<br /><br />Investments - not being able to select a date to review the portfolio is extremely frustrating - receive a month-end brokerage statement on the 5th day of the month, and was not able to find a method to show the portfolio as of the last day.<br /><br />Reports - very lacking.<br /><br />Loan amortizations - completely missing<br /><br />On the plus side, I do like the drag and drop for transactions - enter a transaction into the incorrect account, and it can be dragged and dropped into the correct account.<br /><br />If Intuit follows their typical course of action, many feature of the Quicken 2013 products will stop working in 2016.  Hopefully their Mac products will be better by then.<br /><br />As of now, Quicken is the only program that I am using my older Windows notebook for (although I am curious to test-drive Windows 10).  So I may have an interesting decision next year as to the course I take with the Quicken Product.	2015-07-18

Despite the promotion that it would transfer a disc image from my old XP computer to my new Win 8.1 computer, I have had nothing but problems.  Attempting to save a few days work setting up my new computer by transferring data and installing programs I opted for this program to speed the process.  After a full month and several call to Laplink's tech folks, I still did not have a computer that worked properly.  I  tried three different ways to make the image under the various tech instructions and then tried the PCmover.  The data transferred fine, which I could have done easily with a flash drive, but the only programs to transfer and install fully were readily available online programs like Adobe Reader and Google maps.  I have installed and reinstalled other programs, and still after over another month I am still have problems where the programs are unable to access the data.  I have had two computer specialists look at the computer.  One found problems with permissions which he could not fix entirely and the second has now advised reformatting the disc and starting over the &#34;slow&#34; way of installing individual programs.	2015-07-18

I bought this product at Office Max, and I regret it.<br />I tried to make a simple birthday card, a job that was easy with my old software, but a cumbersome chore with this product.  Instead of giving me an intuitive front, inside left/top, inside right/bottom, and back, it gives 1, 2, 3, 4, and it failed to be consistent where pages 3 and 4 wound up on the page if I tried to leave the back of the card blank.  It wasn't even consistent in where pages 3 and 4 were printed between the print preview and what actually got printed.  As a result, I had to print several draft cards before I got everything in the desired positions, wasting paper, ink, and most importantly, time.  I wish I could return this product.<br /><br />I should also mention that the Undo / Redo for the &#34;page&#34; (1, 2, 3, or 4) gets forgotten as soon as you look at another &#34;page&#34; of your card!  That resulted in a few manual redos that wasted still more time.	2015-07-18

The old versions of this software were excellent.  I have followed all of my personal finances with Quicken since January of 1992 and swore by the program.  Until this version.  It crashed the first time I loaded it and it clearly wasn't ready for release.  After updating it the first few times it quit crashing.  Starting this month it started dumping out of the program when I download from my bank.  I can't tell you how many times I have had to shut down the program due to hang ups and freezes before during and after downloads.  If you can't download without issue then you need another software.<br /><br />The truth here is that Intuit is so focused on making money off selling your personal information that the software is no longer about following your finances.  The software is about spying on your finances.  It will not download without you being signed in to the Intuit mothership.  It regularly has pop ups, that can't be turned, off to sell you additional items.  At one point the software would no longer download from my bank because it couldn't talk to home and send away my information. This is not a stand alone product, it won't work unless it is allowed to spy on you.<br /><br />I'm running a windows 8 operating system but I don't see that as a factor. As a long time user I can't recommend this product and would tell you to look elsewhere for tracking finances.	2015-07-18

If you're going to buy this, be aware that you will receive no useful support if you have a problem.  I set the software to back up every week online, but nothing happened.  What's more, it would not even allow me to back up manually. After waiting for 30 minutes to reach chat support, the tech wanted to remotely access my computer.  (As someone who's designed software, I can assure you this is something you never want to do.  These minimally-trained techs can trash your operating system in a few seconds.)  After about 20 minutes of unsuccessful chat troubleshooting, the tech sent me a link with written instructions, which did not help.  Eventually, I located a support phone number (800-695-0678), but after an hour on hold, I gave up.  I even tried to design a workaround to trick the software into backing up, but after a few minutes it timed out.  Currently reviewing other security software, and by the end of the day I will have uninstalled Norton and moved on.	2015-07-18

Recently my main production PC broke, and I had to replace it. My disks were intact.<br />The same day I got a mail with info about PCmover. After reading the spec.,<br />I bought the program, and installed it in the new computer.<br />Old system disk connected  via USB. The program worked for a couple<br />of hours, analyzing every aspect of the old system and the copied everything<br />exept the OS. Everything was completely restored even some programs that<br />are hard to install.<br />Two years ago I spent a lot time moving three systems from XP to W7.<br />That was a nightmare. PCmover is worth every cent it costs.<br />I strongy recommend it when upgrading, as it also is able to<br />move from XP to a later system.	2015-07-18

Warning - the only problem I had is that Amazon sells a version which will not on windows 8 and I have windows 8. As noted in other reviews, I called Nuance tech support for Omnipage and they sent me a link to download the correct version. And I am very happy Omnipage. I bought a scanner which came with Omnipage 4 SE. Of all the OCRs I have used, Omnipage performs the best. So now that I have upgraded my computer and scanner, I purchased Omnipage 18 from amazon. So just for the fun of it, I scanned two very complex documents together, sideways. Omnipage read them and yielded an almost perfect text document of each page.  The only problem that I found was that the page numbers of the documents were not perfectly centered. Other that that, it was perfect.<br /><br />The speed of conversion was fast. I have a laptop made to work very fast. Some software can slow my computer to a crawl. But with Omnipage, it takes less than one second to convert a page. I am impressed.<br /><br />Since Omnipage sells for $149 on other sites, even if you have windows 8, I would buy the software from Amazon and have Nuance update it. And don't worry, the techs at Nuance receive many calls regarding amazon and know what to do.	2015-07-18

But please, PLEASE AVOID THE DOWNLOAD OPTION. I have had one technological nightmare after another this week and Magix Customer Service Dept is a joke. I bought a new computer a few weeks ago that turned out to have a faulty motherboard so I had to get that all replaced, but my original Magix disc was trapped in the new computer that wouldnt turn on after one initial shutdown /reboot.  I use this software as my main editing program for my Youtube channel so I needed a replacement ASAP. Decided to go with the digital download for convenience but joke was on me I guess. The digitial version appeared to be missing options -- some of them ones I use the most, such as captions. I searched online on tech forums trying to find the solution, everyone was saying &#34;Oh, just go to Help menu and click on Free Download option&#34;. I go in my program, look under Help menu -- no such option listed. I email Magix, tell them the situation to which they send back an email which clearly showed me my request for help was only casually scanned because I got the &#34;Go to your Help menu, click Free Download..&#34; after I specifically said in MY email that that option does not appear to exist. They send me a screenshot of what I'm supposed to see, I send them one back of what my menu looks like. THEN I get an email basically saying &#34;Looks like the file is corrupt, please take off, do a registry clean and reload program -- but keep in mind this could severely mess up Windows and we're not responsible for any damages&#34;. Then they make it impossible to find out how to get a refund on the purchase. So crushed at the money I wasted on this -- could not have happened at a worse time. Like I said, the program itself is very good but PLEASE order the physical copy, save yourself the headache I'm going through.	2015-07-18

The most fundamental building block of NLE (or even for the old tape to tape days) is not a part of this &#34;powerful&#34; video editor. Who designed this? Who decided that inpoint and outpoint were no longer a part of editing? Shame on me for just assuming that a three point edit would be part of the process in this program. SHAME ON CYBERLINK for making an editor without it.<br />So why two stars? Why not just one star? Because it does edit. It does export in a variety of great and useful formats. It is not a memory hog (compared to Media Composer or Premiere) and it does offer a number of bells and whistles. Adding clips to the timeline is easy, adding transitions is easy, moving clips around the timeline is easy. Making titles and subtitles is easy. Its so freaking easy to use this software, but it will take you FOREVER to make precise edits on your timeline. Essentially you drop the WHOLE CLIP into the timeline and remove what you DONT want!!! Talk about backwards.<br />Here is what is horrible:<br />Left key and right key do not move the cursor in the timeline. It is a combination of keys to simply move the cursor. FIX PLEASE<br />There is only a Preview window. No option for preview next to timeline, so no side-by-side comparison of coloring between shots<br />Basic audio editing like rubber banding has to be done in a different &#34;room&#34; not on the timeline<br />Oh, yeah, and there is no three point edit. Are you kidding me?<br /><br />Who this is probably for:<br />Skateboarders who want to set their trick videos to music (tons of options for that stuff)<br />Parents who just want to pare down the ton of video they shot at the birthday party<br />Anyone who has more time than they can handle to assemble accurate clips<br />Absolute beginners who just want to physically manipulate the video and not think about how one clip relates to the next<br />Anyone who doesn't need to sequence, doesnt match on action, doesntmatch audio to video, or doesnt shoot long clips<br /><br />Who should avoid this:<br />Anyone with experience in editing. Especially if you think in terms of three point edits.<br />Anyone who shoots a bunch of their b-roll in one clip (I cant even imagine that nightmare)<br />Anyone who doesnt have time to unlearn what they already know about editing<br />Anyone who likes to work quickly and effeciently<br />Anyone who needs to sequence<br /><br />I am so sorry that I actually bought this software. There is a free trial. I should have tried it. What was I thinking? Now I am $70 lighter (thank goodness for the sale price) and there is no way to get a refund. I am stuck with this headache inducing piece of junk that makes editing so much harder than it needs to be.<br /><br />Dear Cyberlink,<br />Your interface is pretty, your workflow isnt half bad, your icons make sense and the screen isnt cluttered. You made so many aspects of editing easier than the other guys. But you ruined step one. WHY?<br /><br />Will you give me a refund? I doubt it.	2015-07-18

After a computer operating system upgrade my Cook'n program wasn't working correctly so I emailed the company and got a response within several hours that included an apology for my problem, clear instructions and a link for a new download along with a personal comment to let their representative know if I had any other problems. I have used computers for many years and have never enjoyed the level of customer service I have experienced with Cook'n. I have contacted them in the past with questions and have always received a personal response. I highly recommend Cook'n not only for the quality and capability of the program but also for the amazing customer support. And, did I mention that my recipes automatically sync across my computer, iPad and iPhone so even if I am out I can check a recipe to see if I need to pick something up from the store! I wish I could give it extra stars!	2015-07-18

Norton then improved for a couple years, but they seem to be getting worse and worse.  I uninstalled from both my android devices as they were both running intolerably slow.  Slow screen response to slow software activation.

As a busy, multi-business operator, I find the convenience of operating in the cloud indispensable. I currently use Xero in 2 businesses, with multiple partners, in multiple states. We can each complete our individual tasks (invoicing, billing, reporting) and at the end of the quarter or year, turn the whole thing over to our CPA. We just implemented ZenPayroll as an add-on, it makes payroll a breeze. While not all banks sync with Xero, the option is a great time-saver. If you are currently using Square for your merchant account, the transactions, inventory and customers can flow in, minimizing duplication of effort. The customer service we've received from Kahuna has been incredible. If there were 6 stars, we would selected that for our review... Not only do I tell all of my small-business owner friends, I recommend Xero whenever I can.	2015-07-17

I thought this might be easier than re-installing all the applications one by one, but in the end, PCmover seemed to mess up with the Windows startup files, I ended up resetting the new PC to factory default and starting over after a couple of hours of effort. I had high hopes for this product to work, but now I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone. 24-7 customer support appeared to be overseas and sleazy.<br /><br />Background: After having had a PC's SSD fail (data was backed up), we were only trying to take a system image of a Windows 7 laptop (not having issues), put that on an external drive, and transfer it to a new Windows 8.1 machine. As the laptop was not particularly having issues, everything should have gone smoothly according to the PDF documentation on the developer's website. After the 1st migration, the brand new machine indicated trouble at Windows startup, and attempted to repair itself but couldn't. The only thing I could do to start Windows was to either 'refresh' (keep the files but undo the changes in applications) or 'reset' (bring the machine back to factory settings). I did the 'refresh' in order to start Windows, but that beat the purpose of this software by wiping all the apps. (The ones I chose for transfer were all supposedly compatible with the new OS.)<br /><br />Thinking that may have been because I tried migrating multiple drives/partitions at once (although the company gives precise instructions how to do so, which I followed to the letter), I gave it a second go, this time just choosing the old main C:\ drive with applications (mounted VHD). Same problem - after finishing the process, Windows 8.1 wouldn't start.<br /><br />At one point I contacted the tech support phone number. From the name of the rep & accent I'd guess it's answered in India. Which I wouldn't mind, if the service is courteous and competent. The rep was convinced the old PC (the one migrating the image from) was the issue, although I tried to tell himwe took the image from the machine that wasn't having issues. He insisted I should install a 'small piece of software' for him to diagnose the problem. This was my husband's laptop, and he had many windows open (he's a game developer), so I didn't want to close the programs to run the diagnostics as he was gone at the time. So I didn't go through the entire process, but that was also partially because I was a bit taken aback when the rep kept asking me, &#34;Are you Asian?&#34; after I gave him my name. At first I didn't answer since that wasn't relevant to my inquiry, but he repeated the question (as if that should make us buddies??). It was strange to be asked such things in a tech support call, and as I wasn't able to tell what he could do with the system info sharing software, I hung up.<br /><br />Afterward, I reset the new PC to factory setting, because I didn't want to mess up the boot record/wanted a clean start, and just used Windows Easy Transfer (built-in, free) to transfer the files only. Then installed all the applications myself. The failed PCmover process took 2-3 hours of my time and only broke the Windows startup; it may have taken slightly longer to re-do it with Windows Easy Transfer, but it didn't introduce any startup error in the new PC, so that felt much better.<br /><br />Maybe if you have a simple, one-drive (image)-to-another-drive migration with most common productivity software, this might work. I wouldn't try mounting multiple disk images. The software said the process was success, but I had to undo everything (which I wasn't even given an option to 'undo' through the application, like the documentation says it should). So I feel like I just threw away $43 (price + tax).<br /><br />[Edit: The good people of Amazon made it right, when I contacted & explained the software corrupted a brand new PC's startup files. So I got the money back - thank you. Hence 1 star for the product, +1 star for Amazon customer service (not the manufacturer).]	2015-07-17

This sort of software is always limited in that it does not detect sentence structure, punctuation, and other sorts of writing conventions unless the command is spoke.  For example the audio must say &#34;period, quote, etc&#34; in order for those things to appear.  I ignore that limitation in the review and base the rating purely on the gross inaccuracy of the words transcribed from Mp3 files.  The program has a 50% accuracy at best, making it more efficient to simply transcribe the files myself by ear.

Quicken 2015 lacks the agile file importing and transaction matching that Money featured back in 2003. If Microsoft still offered and supported Money, I would dump Quicken in the minute it would take for the online purchase. That being said (and counter-intuitive in that I switched to a Mac), the half-baked version they developed for Mac does not even support Quicken's own bill pay service! I might as well keep my transactions and billing details in Excel, then pay through my bank. I have heard rumors that this is in the works, but my experience with Intuit tells me that it would be years away if at all. I cannot get my ~$75 back, yet I plan to dump this in lieu of Mint or some other solution. The Mac version is a total failure in that if you value the convenience of keeping track of and paying your bills through one interface, you need to keep looking. Does anyone really like Quicken, or is it simply the main player by default?	2015-07-17

The questions are straightforward and will guide you through everything that you need. I only bought the deluxe because I needed to file a couple state returns. The software made it easy for my situation (permanent resident with a job in-state for part of the year, then a different job out of state for the rest of the year), although it probably could've made things a bit more clear on the order in which to file the different returns (info from some of them are needed for the others). Also wasn't a fun of paying for extra state returns when you got five federal returns for free (I thought you should only file one federal return anyway, so not sure why the others are included).	2015-07-17

I'd previously used Windows Vista, which was supposedly awful.  It was pretty bad, but how Microsoft could come up with something even worse boggles the mind!  It started with having to log onto Microsoft and create an account to download this abomination.  Both my IT person and I kept getting repeated error messages trying to enter the simple required information.  For whatever inexplicable reason, it finally worked after more than a couple dozen tries at various times of the day.  Since then, both Excel and Word &#34;have stopped working&#34; at least once on a daily basis (resulting in loss of newly input information). Outlook--for which I specifically bought the more expensive Home & Business version--is a total nightmare, i.e. unable to flag or move opened or previewed messages unless I go to another message and then come back to the one I was trying to flag/more--among other issues.  (My IT person tried to find a fix for this particular issue with Microsoft and determined this was &#34;normal&#34;!??)  What used to be a one-click action now requires 3 or 4 (even the basic act of opening an Excel or Word document).  Instead of enabling users to work more efficiently, Microsoft has managed to decrease efficiency and increase steps, work-arounds...and frustration...to unacceptable levels for business professionals such as me, who work from home, are under deadline and rely on their computers almost 24/7.  As my IT person advised, I should have switched to Apple when I had the chance.	2015-07-17

Don't buy this if you expect anything useful from Family Premier on iOS.  The fine print is very deceiving and bordering on false advertising.  Said differently, it SUCKS!  I've been a Norton customer for many years but never messed with Norton Family.  Next time I'll look elsewhere.  The only thing worse than the product (which doesn't work) is the documentation.

I purchased the Photography Plan during the Prime Day promotion, downloaded the installers, and went to work. I am still using my old version of Photoshop CS3, and I was excited to try out all the new bells and whistles.<br /><br />Two days later, after spending 5+ hours in chat with Adobe Support, I am cancelling my subscription, running every cleaning tool I can find to get rid of all the Adobe folders that have added gigs and gigs of useless crap to my Common Files folders, and doing a system restore back to before I ever started this nightmare.<br /><br />The applications installed, but with errors.  No error messages, but they wouldn't launch, or crashed. They uninstalled, but left so many settings and keys behind, my computer started behaving oddly.  Photoshop would crash every time I saved and exited an image file.  Adobe support ran three different cleaning tools during my sessions with them, and they still couldn't uninstall and reinstall Photoshop and Lightroom properly.  The fact that they were clearly following a script (run tool, set up alternate admin account, disable antivirus and firewall, change permissions on application folders, then give up) didn't help at all.  I was told a &#34;system specialist&#34; would contact me, but I have not heard a thing from them after ending the support session. I can't be too hard on them, though, because this software is so poorly written and so badly coded, it's beyond a nightmare to work with.  My computer is running sluggishly and many system settings have been changed by the Adobe installs (I'm running Windows 7x64, and my laptop is way over-spec'd for this software).  The bloat in my user profile alone is inexcusable.<br /><br />Photoshop is by far the best image software out there right now, and I love working with it.  As soon as it is released on disk again, I'll be purchasing a new copy. But the Creative Cloud model is poorly thought out and poorly executed, and I'm extremely disappointed by this whole experience. I've lost 8+ hours of time to this awful application package.  Never again.But the Creative Cloud model is poorly thought out and poorly executed, and I'm extremely disappointed by this whole experience.

This is the worst software that I have tried this year.  First, I use Windows 8.1, 64B.  I have yet to find a Blu-ray player for 8.1, 64B that works.  My initial installation almost worked.  The key is 64 digits long, so copy and paste.  If you try it w/o the key, it has a lot of wording that obscures the screen so that you can not see most of it.  When the registered version started up, it seemed to work fine.  Then, I saw that the English was a narritive rather than just English.  When I pulled down the menu, English was dimmed out and would not work. I left it at that for that day.  The next day, the software would not boot up without registering it again, and then using the same key as before, the key that worked the day before it said that it was &#34;invalid.&#34;  I've not gotten further since I've run out of time and patience. If I get it to actually work, I'll update this review, but don't count on it since I'm very computer literate. Update 8/26/15 I re-downloaded and installed the software.

I wish there was a &#34;zero star&#34; rating. Every year I have issues with Turbo Tax and swear to never use it again. Lesson finally learned.<br /><br /> Here was this year's problem:<br /><br />When I downloaded the application, I clicked to begin. After four hours of entering in all my information, payment was asked for at the end. This didn't make sense since I had already paid through Amazon. I clicked to continue and thought maybe it just went to that page as a default. Apparently not, and I paid an ADDITIONAL $65 (to come out of my return). I contacted Amazon and they confirmed I never used the one I ordered from them. Somehow when I downloaded TurboTax, it did not connect with the program I had already purchased. I am not sure how this happened since I only downloaded the one from Amazon, not from their website. I have been using TurboTax since 2008 and have never had this issue.<br />  I spent $39.99 on the download, never used it, and then spent ANOTHER $39.99 on the new download and then another $65 to file!!!

I've been looking for a capable CAD/CAM software package that I can legally use at home.  I have used Inventor for years and had a student license when I was in school.  However, now that I am a working stiff, I can't honestly use that student license anymore.  I spent months looking for software that I could reasonably afford that wouldn't cost me as much as my cnc machine to use.  I found it in Fusion 360.  Fusion 360 is a new kind of software platform for Autodesk.  Rather than a pricey up-front cost strategy, they are offering several subscription services ranging from free to (currently) $40/mo or $300/year.  The free license is available to hobbyists and &#34;start ups&#34; which means you can use the software for free as long as you aren't making a profit with it.  If you do end up developing a product for sale, you can roll into the $40/mo or $300/year subscription which is quite affordable even for the adventurous hobbyist like myself.  As far as the software is concerned, It is really quite good especially if you consider the price.  It is not as convenient to use as something like Inventor.  It lacks hot keys and other powerful features like parts libraries.  It also has a bit different kind of assembly methodology using &#34;joints&#34; rather than constraints.  A joint is basically an automated way of doing 3 constraints at once which can be convenient, but can be frustrating as well when you want to do more complex constraints.  That said, it is an EXCEEDINGLY powerful software package.  There is nothing better in the CAD market for under $2-3K for the cad capabilities and absolutely nothing like it for under $4-8K on the CAM side.  It is a fully parametric, fully direct modeling, and fully T-Spline sculpting CAM package with assembly capabilities as well as a model based integrated CAM system.  Further, it is a product that is growing in capability all the time.  It may not be the perfect software for enterprise level work yet, but for the hobbyist and small shop, its more than enough especially at the price level of free.  I do a lot of woodworking and this software is great for making technical and sculpted parts.  However, there are certain things I wish it did that I have been told are coming:  1) V-carving... This is nice for making lettering and signs.  You can do embossing, but making really good letters is not easy at the moment.  2) Part patterning/nesting... when you cut stuff out of sheet stock you really want to make the most of your materials.  Right now, there is not an easy way to even pattern parts with the same CAM operations.  If you need multiple parts, you either have to create a specialized gcode program with work offsets yourself or machine them one at a time.  3) Feeds and speeds calculator... You need this to keep from breaking or burning up your bits.  Right now I use G-Wizzard by CNC Cookbook.  It would save time if Fusion would do an even basic calculation to set these for you.  Because of these short comings, this software is not ideal for CNC routers, but I've been told that these things are coming so maybe I will revise my review to be a full 5 star review when these features are complete because then I would need no other software to do what ever I want.  **** UPDATE **** This morning I got an update of the software.  There is now a CAM Patterning ability.  Maybe it was there before and I didn't notice it, but I just found it this morning.  That is a BIG plus.  I have upgraded my review to 4.5 stars.  I can live without a feeds and speeds calculator as I have one already, but being able to pattern parts in sheet goods is HUGE.  I hope they do a nesting feature too.  If only they did v-carving, I would be super happy.  If they had a sculpting library available for relief carving I would be EXTATIC.  Maybe this is coming too.	2015-07-17

I think I figured it out after several tries. After you download and install the program and start up for the first time, it will prompt you to install and update. DON'T DO THIS. It looks like this update changes the file location and then the language levels can't be found when you restart the program. If you already installed the update (like I did), you can install the older version by going into the ProgramFiles (PC) and looking for a Setup file in the folder with &#34;TOTALe&#34; in the name. You should now have 2 Rosetta Stone shortcuts on your desktop. Open/install the &#34;TOTALe&#34; one, skip the update, and the languages should install automatically after that.<br /><br />I'm typing this as the languages are installing, so I don't know if this will work completely, but hopefully it does.	2015-07-16

I always file under extension so I bought Turbo Tax 2014 Deluxe in July. I used Deluxe 2013 for last year and none of my circumstances have changed materially. Well, running 2014 Deluxe I discovered that I was solicited to pay $30 in order to upgrade to Premiere, because Deluxe no longer supports entering S corp K-1 schedule info for Schedule E. Yet I read in various posts here that Intuit had acknowledged their &#34;mistake&#34; and provided free upgrades for Deluxe customers in my situation. Well it turns out the free upgrade was only if you filed your return by April 30, 2015. The irony is TT reps have stated here that they will have this &#34;fixed&#34; for 2015 returns, which means that for some reason the only customers &#34;burned&#34; by this are those who bought their TT Deluxe in good faith in order to file their 2014 returns on extension. WHY should WE be penalized?! I paid the $30 begrudgingly, because I had done most of the work and wasn't included to start all over with H&R Block software. As far as I am concerned if a tax software is going to drop a major component of what they cover, it's obligated to make this clear in its marketing both in online descriptions and on the box itself. Nowhere does it indicate that Sch K-1 coverage has been dropped.<br /><br />The software seems to work fine, as it did last year. But this kind of &#34;bait and switch&#34; marketing, just to drain more money out of customers.... this just isn't do right by regular customers.	2015-07-16

I don't like the policy of having to &#34;upgrade&#34; every 3 years to maintain the online support. I would prefer a simple subscription and only upgrade when there is a good reason. The last few versions I've installed seem to get worse with each version. They must have learned from Microsoft! But the 2015 version is the worst yet! The installation was anything but smooth. I had to restart it twice. Since then there have been several updates, some of which corrupted everything and I had to reinstall. With each update I hope the bugs I have been fighting have been fixed, but they haven't. Here is a list of the most annoying bugs:<br />* When entering a payee in a register the auto-complete box covers the field, so if it is a new entry I have to type blind until I hit enter.<br />* Occasionally CTRL/B doesn't start the backup and I have to dig through the menus to find where to initiate the backup.<br />* When selecting a category, the auto-complete doesn't let me hit the down arrow to navigate to a sub-category. The same is true of check numbers.<br />* The enter key doesn't move to the next field when filling in the opening dialog for reconciling an account. It does in other places in the program.<br />* The remembering of payees is erratic, sometimes it remembers, sometimes it doesn't.<br />* I have dual screens on my computer, but they have different resolutions. When I move quicken to the larger screen and make it full screen the panes get messed up and I can't see most of them. Reducing the size allows it to fill the panes correctly.<br />* When second screen is disconnected and I open Quicken, it tries to put it on the disconnected screen and I can't get it back. A real problem when I take my laptop with me on the road!<br /><br />Come on Intuit! Let's do some testing before you release new versions. At the very least the stuff that used to work should continue to work. And please fix the constant hanging! I'm notsure which is worse, Quicken 2015 or Windows 8.1!	2015-07-16

If you take someone like me that used Illustrator only somewhat regularly, often skipping a month or two without using it at all, this is simply going to force me out.  Let's say I need it for a project that takes 3 hours.  And that's all I use it for in a 6-month period.  I'm paying Adobe $180 to &#34;rent&#34; their software for that one project.  I suppose I could go through the hassle of stopping and starting the subscription every time I open it up or decide I don't need it for a while... but then if I need to pop it open again a week later, I have to pay the $30 again.  Of course I'm not going to do that, so... yeah, basically when my old version of Illustrator ceases to function next time I upgrade a computer or an OS, I'm just out.  Very sad.  I've loved Illustrator over the last 15+ years of working with it.	2015-07-16

Well, I just bought this software and I was immediately confronted with failure. It wouldn't install.  For reference I'm running a windows 8.1 machine with 18GB of ram, and plenty of processing power. There wasn't even an error. The installer simply said that the 'installer was interrupted... no modifications have been made to your system'.  Which is an incredibly unhelpful message, especially when it appear below the INSTALLER COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY part, which normally means that the installer worked.  Now I did manage to get it installed, and it's a really stupid trick. I had to be an admin. As a regular user, even using the admin password, even using Run As Admin, it would not install.  Once I switched my user account to admin, it installed (though I did have to reboot once in the middle of the installation, per the prompt which instructs you to do so, but uses the ever so vague &#34;unless you've rebooted multiple times&#34; qualifier).  I haven't had a chance to try the software itself out yet. I'm hoping that since I've gotten it installed I can switch back to the safety of being a regular user without it breaking. I'll update this review as I go along, but for now I'm leaving it at 3 stars. A painful installation, but a successful one.   *EDIT Forget successful. While it technically installed, the program won't even open. As soon as I try to start it the typical &#34;Dragon NaturallySpeaking for Windows has stopped working&#34; message appears.  I've got the problem signature to prove it:  Problem signature:   Problem Event Name: BEX   Application Name: natspeak.exe   Application Version: 13.0.0.86   Application Timestamp: 53d05283   Fault Module Name: MSVCR110.dll   Fault Module Version: 11.0.51106.1   Fault Module Timestamp: 5098858e   Exception Offset: 000a326c   Exception Code: c0000409   Exception Data: 00000007   OS Version: 6.3.9600.2.0.0.768.101   Locale ID: 1033   Additional Information 1: 54fa   Additional Information 2: 54fab474a00286fcc34df8f2475d560c   Additional Information 3: e667   Additional Information 4: e6678fb31c6080a780c1c8c33dbeae8e  I'll keep trying to get this working.

The reason why Free is NEVER FREE...  ***FAST FOWARD***.... And once I have it installed on my computer. Went to the AVAST page on how to OPT OUT OF DATA COLLECTION .... Guess what it is not letting me opt out.  I called the AVAST PHONE NUMBER talked to somebody in their &#34;TECHNICAL DEPARTMENT&#34;  NAMED JOE in San Jose.. He gave me his agent number which he probably made up. # 1172  I told him that my computer wasn't allowing me to optout of the data sharing. He said he didn't understand what I was saying. I was now PISSED OFF and I repeated the EXACT SAME THING. All of a sudden now he understands what I am referring to. ..He said that even though he is in their technical department he can not help me... He claimed that there were no supervisors for me to speak to. He told me he would have to report this to their &#34;engineers&#34;.. and that for me to get this resolved  I WILL HAVE TO PAY TO UPGRADE THE SYSTEM..  THEY TOLD ME I HAVE TO PAY TO UPGRADE TO OPT OUT OF THE DATA SHARING... WHAT COMPLETE GARBAGE ...  ... And here is the report I am sending to the BBB...&#62;&#62;  I downloaded Avast Virus protection from Amazon.com  I had to read and sign off on the AVAST PRIVACY Disclosure statement that said I could opt out of their data sharing program.   Once the AVAST program was installed on my computer it started operating BEFORE I WAS OFFERED to option of OPTING out of data collection.    I was reading the directions on how to OPT OUT of their data collection program. My system wasn't letting me opt out. So I called their support phone number  I called AVAST  1-866-951-7679  https://www.avast.com/en-us/support  I spoke to a rep who said he was in their technical assistance program. He said his name was Joe and I asked for his Agent ID number which he was hesitant to give to me. AGENT # 1172 is what he said. He told me he is in SAN JOSE.   He told me that he didn't know what I was talking about. Once I got upset he then told me he knew what I was talking about but he couldn't do anything to assist me. He said that I would have to PAY FOR UPGRADED SERVICE TO OPT out of their data collection program. I asked for a supervisor. He told me that I could not speak to a supervisor. I asked him if supervisors were there and he said yes. He then hung up on me.	2015-07-16

I got this software to replace an old DOS program that I got in 1992!  I loved it as I could easily enter my own recipes.  Over the years I did wonder if there was something better, and I did download a number of trial run subscriptions.  None of them were as good as my old software, COOKBOOK.  Two years ago along came a new computer and my old DOS program would no longer work.  I was forced to find something else as I was tired getting that old computer out every time I wanted a recipe!  That is when I found Cook’n!  I watched Dan’s demo video and said to myself “this is the one!”  It is the only one I reviewed where I could easily get all 300+ recipes from my old software into the new.  Using the “snip it” tool made it very easy!  This software does so much and I have not even touched on some of the things it will do.  I love it that when I see a recipe online that I would like to  have, all I need to do is have Cook’n open and enter the name and I can “capture” it right into my software.  I have had some issues that were easily resolved by the great support staff.  They try to respond quickly and I have not had to wait long.  I love using the computer and I have enjoyed the fact that you can do so much with this software.  I highly recommend it!	2015-07-16

The program is EXCELLENT, but the CC program pricing is where it falls apart.  While the other programs are fine under the CC deal, the cost for the DW only option, or lack of ability to choose a package even, is where they fail -- miserably. I love you Adobe, but you have let this LONG time buyer down greatly.  The Pricing Model for &#34; Forced Leasing&#34; is not appropriately priced.   For anyone who is looking for an amazing Website Tool and can afford the monthly fee, this IS IT. But the complaints that you see here, are toward the pricing model, not toward the program necessarily. Long time users have fallen away from Adobe due to this. I have proudly purchased Adobe products, since 2.0,  I have spent thousands of dollars investing into Adobe products for over 20 years, because they are excellent, no one does them better. However, this model of &#34;leasing&#34; the program, is killing not only long time users, but new.   There are many people who can not afford this level of investment every month just to &#34;keep it new&#34;, most casual users will use older versions of a program for a while, till they can save up for the newer versions, with this model, it makes it impossible to even do that. Sadly, Adobe is forcing this leasing model on individuals who truly need this program, and who are not making money with it, but will never be able to buy it at this rate.   Yes, I totally understand they are doing it to prevent the pirated copies out there, I get that. I know they had to do something... But there must be some other way, instead of writing off a huge market . I need this program, but i can't do the price, so I do without. I am sad, so very very sad for Adobe having to make this drastic and loyal customer killing move.	2015-07-16

I mostly have negative comments about word 2010 to 2013 upgrade: * Table width is now constrained by the document margins, which means that users cannot change the format of their old documents without dramatically altering their layout. Why not giving users a choice? I do not see why this is so complicated... * The neat draft mode and plan mode icons disappeared from the status bar. Why removing a handy feature? That does not make sense! * It's no longer possible to show/hide the ruler with a mouse click. Another neat feature gone for no reason * Cumbersome spellcheck compared to that of 2010 * The navigation button below the right scroll bar disappeared (the one that was similar to F5, but with more features) - Why? * Messed up text boundaries that can no longer be shown without getting annoying lines across the entire document * Modifying the ribbon requires awkward manipulations * Handy features disappeared form the right click menus (e.g. update style) and they cannot be modified as in earlier versions of Word * Silence of the Office team despite bitter remark from users on various fora. This place seems to be an exception, that's good. As far I am concerned, I made up my mind. I'll stick to Word 2010, but I am afraid I won't be given much choice with the new versions of Windows. This 2013 release and the way criticism is handled gives me the feeling that Microsoft is moving further away from a customer centric culture to a developers culture, where techies know better than the users what they need and what's good for them.	2015-07-16

It took a bit of time to get all the the proper categories put there and also had to play with a couple of things, but having used it for several weeks, I am very happy with it.<br /><br />One problem is that I have it on both my desktop and laptop and what is entered on one does not automatically go on the other.  They say that is in the next upgrade.  I hope so...	2015-07-15

I have used Kaspersky for many years and it has never let me down. This version, like all the rest I have used, is efficient, easy to use and simple setup. I have this on 5 different devices and as always, I have a good feeling of safe internet and network safety. I have tried other security software in the past and they have all let me down. My only complaint, or wish list for Kaspersky rather, is that a license could be purchased for longer than a year. Overall, I ALWAYS recommend Kaspersky for anyone needing security software or I am the one building their system. Don't lose your computer/portable device to a bug or hack when for $50-$80 it can be protected.	2015-07-15

Yes, the program was very frustrating for the first few days while I &#34;trained&#34; it to recognize my voice, but the accuracy improved every day and now I would guess that it's about 90-95% accurate, which is perfectly acceptable for what I use it for. I have found that my Mac's built in mic doesn't do so well with the dictation portion of the program so I would recommend checking into a mic upgrade if this is what you'll be using Dragon for. I dictate into a handheld recorder (Olympus brand) and then use the transcription function to get my words on the screen, and this is proving to be a huge time save for me now that I've struggled through the initial training process. My advice, don't get frustrated. Give yourself a week or two of working with the program before you decide to kick it to the curb. I don't think Dragon is for everyone, but for those people who have the patience to stick with it, the program can be a really valuable tool.	2015-07-15

I have gone through numerous upgrades over the years and have experienced any of the problems that I've seen mentioned in the user reviews over the years.  However, with the 2015 version, that story is very different.  I upgraded a couple months ago due to the 3-year rule that Intuit has in place now for online services.  I was very happy with Quicken 2012 and would have stayed with it, but I was forced to upgrade.  The first problem I had was the file corruption/password lockout issue that Intuit has since released a patch to address.  I had that problem right after I upgraded.  After I fixed it, Quicken worked fine until this week when it decided that it wasn't going to show me downloaded transactions for my checking account anymore..  It shows that they have been downloaded in the one step update summary, but they are nowhere to be found.  I have about 6-7 accounts that I download transactions for, but this is the only one having the problem.<br /><br />I've spent a couple of hours trying to figure it out and Google the problem.  I see others have reported similar problems, but I don't see a fix.  I guess I'm going to open up a ticket with Intuit tomorrow.  Needless to say, I'm very unhappy with this version so far and Intuit's overall strategy to force people to upgrade to versions that they don't need.  I wish there was still a decent competitor like Microsoft Money to keep Intuit honest.  And I wish Intuit would make a Mac version that was as good as the Windows versions have been.  I hate having to fire up a Windows machine just to balance the books.  Oh well... Maybe some day.	2015-07-15

When this product came out our company purchased the ultimate edition.  In short I feel as if I am being forced to pay for beta testing of this product. And maybe this is because I come from the Inventor side of things where the product is very usable.  Fusion seems as if it is a product that needs to mature before it is usable in a engineering production type scenario. The user interface is very lacking and hard to navigate when compared to Autodesk Inventor and any other parametric software The video rendering has issues when being used with Hybrid graphics cards It has Zero integration with other Autodesk desktop software Importing and exporting native Inventor files is not easy and requires multiple steps. You need internet access to view and edit existing files.  No offline option (local copy) that I know of for current cloud based files.

Downloads have stopped working with Wells Fargo.	I decided to try this after a miserable failure with Windows version of home and business and Wells Fargo Bank last year.  The reviews seemed better than I’d read in a long time for the OS X version so, after trying iBank, thought I’d give it a try.  Also, most bad reviews are based on this not looking/working like quicken for Windows.    Here is what I've learned:  1. When you set it up, be very carful of account type.  It’s best guess with (Wells Fargo) is frequently wrong, eg credit card accounts being identified as checking accounts.  The only way to fix this is to delete the account and start over. 2. Adding old QIF files have to be converted to QFX files if you’ve started with downloads from your bank.  This is easily done with a utility from Money Tumb.  It costs 34 bucks, but is well worth it.  The rub is there are times when the downloaded transactions disappear.  I needed this as I started with a bank download and had to back fill transactions.  If you start out with QIF files and then download you may be able to avoid the backfill and cost for Money Thumb. 3. Renaming an investment account after downloading may cause it to disappear, but the data and balances are there.  After nearly an hour in chat with quicken support, I tried hiding it in the list where you can do that, (you could see it there) and un-hiding it.  That caused it to reappear.  This is what I mean by buggy.  Put you beta testing hat on where you use this software and back up frequently.  After adding accounts, look closely at the preceding account set ups to make sure nothing is scrambled. Overall this version works better with Wells Fargo than my last Windows Home and Business running in Parallels, and better than iBank.  It does look quite workable after the initial bumps. Updated review down to 1 star.  Downloads with Wells Fargo have stopped working.  It's unbelievable how unstable this software is after all these years.  The usual advice and something you have to do all too frequently (disconnect and reconnect accounts for download) no longer works.  If you look, this problem has come up repeatedly over the years.  Unbelievable.	2015-07-14

Prior to yesterday I would have said that the subscription service was a problem but the programs are not.  However, after all my purchased software reverted to trial software that I cannot use, now I know that the software is subpar.   I am really regretting that I purchased Creative Cloud.  The first mistake was day one, I somehow ended up with a prepaid one year membership.  The last I ever want to do is prepay a corporation for a subscription service.  Because, when they don't provide the service as advertised, guess what, they don't offer any refunds for the lack of service.   The larger cultural issue is how corporations in general give such lousy customer service.  Once they have your money they really will do everything possible to hold onto it regardless of whether they are right or wrong.  (One exception is Amazon, kudos for their convenient return policy.)   So right now I have an unusable subscription that I have to put my time and effort into fixing myself.	2015-07-14

No more freezing, no more waiting forever for websites to upload..I dont know why i have this experience with Norton Security with Backup though...I just dont like it...	2015-07-14

I am writing this specifically about DOWNLOADED AutoCAD from Autodesk.  I'm an independent consultant.  I bought the previous version of LT from Autodesk, downloaded it on my laptop, used it for a few months and then my laptop was stolen.  After getting a new computer I made several efforts to contact Autodesk and reinstall AutoCAD on my new laptop.  It was nearly impossible to get someone to speak with me.  If you're a small business or individual assume that you will never (ever) speak to Autodesk without paying for it through some sort of support agreement.  When I finally did get someone to &#34;help&#34; me she provided me with a link to download AutoCAD, which turned out to download the trial version, and would require me to pay the entire value again.  Now I need AutoCAD for another project and here I am having to buy it.  Again.  My advice is to ALWAYS BUT AUTOCAD IN A BOX.  You cannot trust this company to help you if you don't by dozens of licenses at a time.  It’s worth the extra $250.00 or whatever is &#34;fair&#34; for a box and a CD.	2015-07-14

The only reason I bought this was that the version of Quicken I had was no longer going to be supported.<br />the cost of this software was not worth the upgrade.  I could see really no improvement from the previous version.  The previous version of this product also doesn't work properly with Vanguard if spouses have Vanguard retirement accounts with the same employer.  The problem was still in this version of Quicken.  Vanguard gave me a workaround but it is tricky to do.<br />What is really, really bad now is that release 7 of this product had a bug in it.  The bug messed up the password and you could not open your data file.  Release 8 was issued on May 23, but Intuit did not push this out to their users.  Today, July 14, I was unable to open the file that I had spent many hours doing updates to the previous date.  Intuit had me upload the file for password removal, but then I received an email saying they couldn't repair the file.  So, I've lost a lot of time as I spent time today working with the customer support.  I do have the backup from last week, but not worth the time to redo - time will be spent on an alternative.<br />Don't buy this product!!!  There are other alternatives and I am going to find something that has to work better than this dinosaur.	2015-07-14

I had a trial for it that came with my new computer last year and I like it enough to subscribe for a year.  Well.. it's renewal time coming up and you can either get price gouged by McAfee via auto-renewal (where they charge you full retail), or you could turn off auto-renewal and order and apply a new one year sub at a 25% discount (current offer at their site), OR if I click on renew subscription from inside Live Safe, they offer a 38% discount, OR.. buy a retail card for a savings of 62% currently here on Amazon digital services.  Clearly, I went for the 62% discount via Amazon, got my code, and proceeded to try to attach it to my existing account.  Thing is.. the instructions are obscure and if you don't do it exactly right.. you will get an error and need to talk to live support.  &#62;&#62;&#62;  How to add this product to your existing active McAffee Live Safe install:  first and foremost.. you must get to the correct website page to start your your journey ----&#62;  mcafee.com/mls/retailcard  then enter the registration code and follow the instructions.  If that fails for any reason, you will need to talk with live support.  Note: I personally did not do this, but the Customer Support person who fixed my problem did (via Citrix remote session) and said it is very important to access the correct retailcard page when adding to an existing account.  Key Point:  Follow the directions exactly as given in the &#34;how to&#34; instructions given by Amazon with the product and you will probably be fine.  If you don't read the instructions and follow them exactly... expect to have issues.  Since they sell a truck load of retailcards (both physical and digital) in the market place, I really don't understand why we can't just add the retail card registration code directly within the McAffee user panel on the PC.  It would be so much simpler and less troublesome.. but hey.. maybe someday.	2015-07-14

I needed a screen recorder to create an online course, so I bought this yesterday, hoping all these positive reviews were correct. And you know what, they were right on! I love this program! It's much cheaper than Camtasia and a much better alternative than those &#34;free&#34; ones online that have malware and viruses attached to them. It works very intuitively and online support was quick and responsive (within two hours I got an email response that completely fixed my problem - I needed to update the drivers to my graphics card). You can choose between different screen sizes to record (or just grab your entire display if needed), press the Record button, do what you will on the screen, and then hit Stop to save. There's an option to hook up a microphone to your computer so you can speak while you record everything on the screen. I just ordered a USB microphone and will test it over the next few days to see how the audio component sounds.	2015-07-14

US	51126743	R24J1Y9C9UHHP4	B00MHZ71G2	8655796	Norton Security with Back Up	Digital_Software	4	1	1	N	Y	reasonable deal...for the next year at least	\\"Norton Security with Backup\\" seems to be the replacement for Norton 360 and perhaps some other similar Norton products. Up to now, Norton had multiple security offerings with different sets of features. Now the main options seem to be 5 devices without backup or this version, 10 devices with backup. (This reminds me of how Microsoft's marketing department works, with Windows Home, Home Premium, Professional, and so on...they like to keep you guessing which one does what.)<br /><br />The best thing about Norton is that it seems to deliver on the security promise. I've seen friends' computers ravaged by viruses...not pretty.<br /><br />When you purchase from Amazon, you receive an email containing the product key and a \\"how to redeem this item\\" link. The link in turn tells you to go to norton.com/setup and enter the product key. (Not sure why the email couldn't just say that in one spot, but whatever.)<br /><br />What you actually happens is that Norton will ask you to log in to your account, or create an account if you don't have one. Then you'll have a chance to enter the product key. After setting up the first device, all you have to do is log in to your Norton account on the next device, and you won't need the product key again.<br /><br />In my case, I had Norton 360 installed on several systems. Norton Security took care of uninstalling 360 on my Win 7 and 8 systems. I had to uninstall 360 manually on my old XP laptop, but this was not a major problem.<br /><br />I keep a separate administrator account on my Windows systems. Most programs are smart enough to prompt for the admin credentials if you try to install something as an ordinary user. For whatever reason, the Norton Security installer doesn't work this way. I resorted to right-clicking and selecting \\"run as administrator\\" to get around this limitation. In the future, I'll break down and log in to the administrator account.<br /><br />Norton does continue to have some annoyances. One issue with the new product is that they seem to have removed the ability to allow regular users to configure things like when high CPU alerts occur. It also appears that you must be an administrator to configure backups. Not an issue for folks who always run as administrator, which is kind of like driving without your seat belt. Not a problem until it's a problem.<br /><br />More annoying is the nagging warnings you get as renewal time approaches. With Norton 360, I was getting daily popup windows, which reappeared shortly after I closed them. And the renewal links offered a shamelessly bad deal. Mine offered to renew the Norton 360 5-device license for the \\"special price\\" of \\"only\\" $69.99. So the 10-device version seems like a bargain at about $55 here.<br /><br />Now over a week after updating to Norton Security, I'm getting emails about how my Norton 360 has expired. The good part is that my \\"special\\" price of $69.99 is still available. OK, you are dumb, how dumb to you think I am? These dumb emails don't have an \\"unsubscribe\\" link.<br /><br />So while the core security function has been working for me, I'm a little tired of Norton/Symantec overall. Right now, the Norton Security tray icon on my Win 8.1 system has a little red exclamation point...it says \\"you have not removed outdated files left behind by Internet Explorer\\". Well, I don't even *use* Internet Explorer, so probably not a major issue. A colleague once said the only proper use for an exclamation point is the sentence \\"I've been stabbed!\\". Some folks need to take that to heart.<br /><br />Maybe more serious is the issue of trust. If you \\"trust\\" Norton to protect your digital life, it's too bad you can't trust them to treat you fairly at renewal time. All the nagging popups aside, at some point they should inform you about the new product, and give you some shopping options if they can't offer a competitive price.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'll be doing some serious shopping when renewal time comes around next June.	2015-07-14

The customer service team and Dan Oaks the President and founder have been working tirelessly to get the website, the Mac software and the iPhone/iPad apps all working together seamlessly.  Just today Mr. Oaks emailed me saying they are working updating the older recipes in the archives so that they are Mac compatible to download.  The new iPhone app is improving on a regular basis.  When the old app wasn't working they decided to tackle it from the ground up and rebuild.  It took a while the but the results are worth the wait.  If you LOVE recipes, have an addiction to collecting them on the web and in magazines and emails etc but need ONE Amazing place to organize them all, Try Cook'n with the apps.  I have not used the Android apps but I understand they work the same way.  I have tried every major and minor cookbook software available for the Mac, this wins Hands Down!  Expect a few glitches as they work out the new iPhone app in phases but customer service is helpful and resolves them efficiently.  Do not let any growing pains deter you.  This Software is the ONLY Software I have ever used with recipe capture right from the internet. For those of us who get bored with our recipes easily we NEED this feature, always being on the prowl for a new idea.	2015-07-13

You get much more than just get the apps you get plenty of services that once you start using you wish you can never go back. Typekit for instance is about $50k worth of fonts and it is available to use with the subscription. The market has plenty of great brushes, clip art, and many templates I use on a daily basis. The cloud storage is also a great way to share PSD files for anyone who doesnt have Photoshop and it is perfect for collaborating and using the automatic version control.<br /><br />I see a lot of harsh reviews and the majority of them are users who didn't even purchase the Creative Cloud. How can you review something that you never used?<br /><br />With the applications we are still getting plenty of updates and they are consistently adding more and more features that make you more productive and save you a lot of time. The new libraries in the Creative Cloud Apps is worth updating to to CC alone. You pretty much have all of your assets like images, fonts, and color swatches saved in a library and is synced though out all of the apps. And if you use the object in the library, let's say the company logo, and your company just updated it. All that you need to do is update the logo in the library and it will update all of the logos in your projects with that library logo. Just AMAZING and such a time savor, also great to quickly add company colors and fonts.<br /><br />I could go on and on about new features and enhancements from CS6 to CC 2015 but I would recommend downloading the trial and going to Adobe's website where they have videos and training's on all of the applications and all of the new features.	2015-07-13

I bought the Cook’n software a couple of years ago to help me with a food allergy issue. I was put on a 4-day rotation plan, where I couldn’t eat the same thing on consecutive days. I was bewildered as to how I was going to sort all my menus out until I hit on the Cook’n software and its category system. It was a breeze!<br />Another plus is that I can run around the Internet looking for recipes to suit my allergies and, when I find one, I can instantly post it into my software. Even if the recipe doesn’t suit me exactly, I love it that I can tailor any ingredient/amount to what’s healthy for me. I can access my recipes any time; put it on my tablet for easy use in the kitchen; and easily share recipes on social media or e-mail.<br />I recently joined the Cook’n Club. What a gold mine! Besides getting a FREE COOKBOOK EVERY MONTH, I am participating in the Cook’n forum, which is a perk in my day.<br />I recently had technical issues (for reasons still unknown). The tech staff at DVO is top-notch! They stuck with me until the issue was resolved, and now I am enjoying Cook’n all over again. (I like that all my recipes are automatically backed up to the cloud, and I never lost a recipe or my organization.)<br />I highly recommend this software for beginning, intermediate, or advanced cooks.	2015-07-13

For example, recently the search function just stopped working. Had to close the doc and reopen. Other weird little bugs, too. Nothing deal killing, but annoying.

I have been using Vegas 7 as a staple for all my video editing needs, and decided that it was time for an upgrade.  It took me a bit of time to get the interface set up properly so I was comfortable with it, but it has a lot of options there. There is even a 'sony vegas' theme on it where the program looks and feels like the old program I am used to, but the only difference is that has more capabilities.  One important note though, if you plan on using avi's or DivX files, they will not work without a codec pack installed. Other than that small thing, it's great and really worth the price. I would highly recommend the Platinum version, as the regular, cheaper version doesn't have the advanced editor in it, which is really important and makes editing a lot easier.	2015-07-13

It is my go-to program for importing / editing / storing photos both from my Canon DSLR and my family's smartphones.<br /><br />However, I was unhappy about how long Adobe took to fix glaring issues in their previous Lightroom 5, and now Adobe's new policies for Lightroom 6 are another thorn in my side.  Specifically, the policy that standalone versions of Lightroom 6 will get no feature updates is just a poor way to treat new and long-time Lightroom customers.<br /><br />Looking at updates to the *previous* Lightroom 5, there were bug fixes of course, but Lightroom also gained the following functions:<br />- Lightroom 5.2: added Feather control for the Clone/Heal brush, added Smoothness adjustment slider for Color Noise Reduction.<br />- Lightroom 5.4: added support for Lightroom Sync.<br />- Lightroom 5.7: added integrated Aperture/iPhoto importer.<br />Nothing huge, but definitely some useful features.<br /><br />Now with Lightroom 6, features added to the CC (subscription) version are being specifically excluded from the standalone product.  The first of these is the Dehaze slider, but I guess there will be others in the future.  And once again my opinion of a good product is marred by the poorly thought out and greedy policies of Adobe.  I'm not sure what the correct policy is - but I do know that the current policy is the wrong one.<br /><br />I've read in a few places that Adobe claims the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 prevents them from adding new features to products already paid for.  However, this flies in the face of real world examples from the small (Angry Birds supplying many new levels for the initial 99 cent purchase) to the quite large (Microsoft giving all Windows 7 and Windows 8 users a free copy of Windows 10).  You need a better excuse, Adobe.<br /><br />Edit - if you've own a previous version of Lightroom *do not* buy the Full version here - buy the Upgrade version directly from Adobe and save $70.version directly from Adobe and save $70.	2015-07-13

World-class application, per the usual for Adobe.

Then after using a competitors AV for several years (about 6-8) I decided to re-evaluate my AV to see if I was still using the best or was there something better.<br /><br />Enter KAV. After some research and a little testing with some known (quarantined) discs, I found that KAV had very good detection of both some very old and very new virus. I also was pleased to find with a little resource monitoring that KAV used somewhat less than my current choice. The interface had been simplified since I had last used it (but still has lots of options) and the sub price point was better as well.<br /><br />The con's. Not too many. There is the occasional false-positive, but I don't know of any AV that is 100% on this (unless they are letting things through the cracks). The only other, which won't be an issue for most, is that there is zero support for windows 10 until it is officially released.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend as long as the Win10 support is ready by release date as I am sure many people will be upgrading given that it's free and easy to do.	2015-07-12
US	34463182	R14S9GAOIRW6PB	B00N9MCPNG	974211135	McAfee 2015 Total Protection 1 PC	Digital_Software	1	1	1	N	N	It took over the system and there was just no way to get any control over it!	The people at McAfee must have engineered this security software with the assumption that it was for the protection of users who are not very good at understanding how to avoid threats on the internet and how to avoid unintentionally downloading viruses and malware.  If you have a seven year old using your home computer to do homework on the net, McAfee Security Center might be worth a look at.  However, if you don't have a seven year old using your PC, and you are aware of some of the risks that are out there, then this software package is probably not for you.<br /><br />I installed McAfee Security Center without any problem.  At first, it seemed to  work okay.  After a while, it took over the system and there was just no way to get any control over it.  It sucked up all available memory.  I run Windows 7 with 4 gigs of physical memory.  It slowed the system up dramatically.  It was preventing perfectly safe sites from loading.  However, I wanted to keep it on my hard drive to use for scans, so I turned it off.<br /><br />Even turning it off didn't work, because anytime I would load a new web page, it would start up again and I would get a reminder message to turn Security Center on.  I installed it a few months ago and uninstalled it within a few weeks.  After a little thought, I reinstalled it a few days ago, hoping for a different result.  Not!<br /><br />For sure, I'm a conservative user.  I don't go to weird web sites.  I don't open email from sources I don't know anything about.  And I really try to keep an eye on security through scans and updates.  For someone like me, McAfee Security Center is sheer overkill.  Maybe if you don't have any understanding of viruses or malware, and/or have a computer with gobs of memory, like maybe a dozen gigs, McAfee Security Center might be a good thing.<br /><br />For me, it wasn't.	2015-07-12

I paid for the download, and then found I couldn't access Pintrest.  I thought it was the web page but could access it from my iphone.  Then I couldn't get into my face book. Then I couldnt get into my bank acount.  And by day three there was nothing the anti virsu program would let me into  but MSN.  I couldn't watch videos because my UTUBE suddenly wouldn't start. Nothing worked. It took me three full days to get the program unistalled because it also blocked me from doing a reset to a prior time which I tried for an entire day.  I finally had to reset my computer to factory settings, loose all of my applications and everything else to get the damn thing out of my computer and start over. And after three days of this BS I can now use my computer again- fullly.  DO NOT USE THIS PROGRAM UNLESS YOU DONT WANT TO USE YOUR COMPUTER.,  Maybe install it on the computer of someone you hate but other than that- NO.	2015-07-12

Only buy if you have to, because you're captive like me	I would not buy this crappy software if I hadn't been using Quicken for 10+ years already.  Features don't work as advertised (auto fill was completely screwed up after upgrade until later release), the crack staff have released updates that screwed up thousands of customers, only to pull the release, leaving us stranded, support is left to the &#34;community&#34;.  Expensive, poor quality, terrible support.<br /><br />I was forced to upgrade when the &#34;turned off&#34; web-connect for bank download for the old version I had been using.  This is really terrible, money-grubbing, awful behavior.  They claimed they notified me, but I never received any notice; to make it worse, I lost an entire Saturday morning, because when on-line services stopped working on the morning they decided to turn it off, the old version I had been using, just returned a generic error message.  Once I finally learned what had happened, I was forced to upgrade.  That was a disaster.<br /><br />Like others, I had to install it three times.  On first try, Quicken crashed, leaving the install incomplete and the software would not run.  On the second try, password vault (when using your Quicken Cloud account as the authentication method) didn't work, leaving me locked out of my own data.  On the third attempt, it at least installed, but then many features didn't work until I downloaded several patches.  It wasn't until this past weekend that I found the &#34;Mondo&#34; patch that fixed a bunch of issues.  (Seriously, &#34;Mondo&#34; patch??  Are these programmers high-school hacks that find the &#34;coolest&#34; nerd name they can think of?

There seems to be a lot to like in terms of features, capabilities, and quality of results. But it's really, really hard to get past just how clunky the user interface is. Some examples:  1) This is really a program for working on a single image. Although it does include a &#34;browser&#34; that lets you pick the image to be edited from a folder, the browser is slow and doesn't really add any value.  2) For Raw files, first you pick the white balance setting, then you open the file. If you don't like the result, you close the file, pick another white balance setting, then reopen the file. Repeat until you're mostly happy. Virtually every other editing program lets you adjust the white balance while you're seeing how it affects the image. Almost every other editing program gives you an &#34;eyedropper&#34; you can use on a neutral point in the image to set the white balance, but not this one. Also, white balance is purely color temperature, with no ability to adjust the magenta/green axis.  3) There is no Undo. This is a non-destructive editor, so it's certainly possible to go back and reset things by hand as long as you remember how they used to be set, but a lot of times it's just easier to hit CTRL-Z to undo a mistake or an experiment. Not here. CTRL-Z takes you to the last &#34;restore point&#34; you create by hitting SHIFT-Z. If you haven't created a restore point, CTRL-Z has no effect.  4) You always have to start from one of the presets. You can create your own Custom preset that has no initial effect and use that as a starting point, but should that really be necessary to do?  5) Before/after comparison is limited to a small window with a movable divider. That's not unheard-of, but most editors provide a button you can press to momentarily show the Before image.  6) There's no preview for the &#34;effects&#34; (the adjustment layers that make the changes). To see if you want to use a particular effect, you have to add it and then, if you didn't want it, you delete it. Deleting an effect always requires clicking &#34;Yes&#34; on a confirmation dialog and there's no way to turn off that confirmation. Since there are 85 effects to choose from, this gets old really fast.  7) Cropping is only available during saving. Cropping is completely free-form and by eye; there are no presets for particular aspect ratios, no way to set a specific crop size, and no way to determine what pixel sizes you're cropping to.  For the photographer who just wants to make his pictures look &#34;true to life&#34; or &#34;slightly better than real life,&#34; there's not much here that isn't available in more established products that have a much more pleasant user interface. Also, as the name suggests, Franzis COLOR Projects provides only minimal capabilities for producing black-and-white images (Franzis offers two other programs for that purpose).  The creative, especially the professional creative tasked with producing color images that project a particular ambiance, flair, or emotional impact, might well find Franzis COLOR Projects to be worth the hassle. It's capable of an incredibly wide range of creative &#34;looks,&#34; and those looks seem to be very nicely done. Learning one's way around the 85 effects and their respective controls, 84 preset settings, and 35 color-film emulations is going to take a fair amount of time and dedication.	2015-07-12

I bought this software with high hopes based on what it is capable of. It is capable of a lot, but the user interface and workflow is horrible!

Othrrwise, you get the feeling that you are working blind. Why!?!  In addition, the publishers website offers a no hassle money back if you aren't happy guarantee. I wasn't happy, and they don't give you your money back if you don't buy it from their official seller. Total BS. of course, Amazon doesn't refund software purchases, so I got screwed.<br /><br />I wound up subscribing to Adobe Muse and I got my site up and running in an evening. Do yourself a favor, and don't buy X5's software. They could have a user interface that compares with Muse, Freeway, Squarespace, or any number of other brands.  I wasted my money, but I hope if you are reading this, you don't learn same hard lesson I did. skip this software! Get something more modern, more forward thinking and easier to use.

I decided to buy it since my trial versions was up in 2 days and it had been working well with no hiccups. So I bought it and entered the code into my existing McAfee version already running on my computer, it said I had to still re-download it from scratch even though I had an existing version on my computer. Okay, no biggie, re-downloaded it. So 10 mins later after its completely done and I go to start-up my Blizzard game; I am prompted to download updates for my game. Not a problem, as I have had to do this done this 3 times already since buying the game. All the sudden, it wont download. It says content is blocked. I then disable the firewall in McAfee; still wont download. I try disabling everything, filters, I check my connections making sure my game has permission to upload; still wont download. At this point I go into chat mode with Mc Afree, being walkthrough how to disable it. Still wont work and having exhausted all the options she had, she says a window setting is blocking it, its not the software. I tell her the software caused this; how I have had the trial, downloaded this game several times before; I even tried my other computer in the house and it downloaded todays update no problem. Mope, she claims its a &#34;coincidence&#34; that downloading this and having problems happened today. BS. After spending another hour trying to do walkthroughs from Microsoft to fix the problem; I am forced to reboot the entire computer from factory settings and am downloading the game, guess what? the game now downloads.<br /><br />The problem is this software changes your firewall configurations and even being a novice gamer whom isn't new to computers, I still could not figure out what the hell it did. Stay away from this software and be advised it will mess up your ability to download content.	2015-07-11

My laptop blew up earlier this year so I had to purchase a refurbished one that came with windows 8. My last has windows 7 so I had to upgrade my Norton and so far this has been wonderful. The laptop came with it's own &#34;security&#34; version and right away I was getting hot left and right with viruses. As soon as I downloaded Norton, they killed them all and I have been safe since. I wold definitely recommend this!	2015-07-11

Then check out Xero!	I've been a long-time Quickbooks user. My accountant uses Quickbooks. Man, is he going to hate me now!<br /><br />I took the plunge to check out Xero. And I can't tell you how easy it is to use. I am not an accountant. I am not a bookkeeper. I am the owner of an ecommerce store using Amazon and Shopify (actually 3 Shopify stores: US, UK, AU), and transacting in 3 different currencies. My home currency is the USD as I'm based in the US.<br /><br />Quickbooks was nothing short of a pain in the a$$ when it came to reconciling three currencies from my PayPal accounts. And accounting for the inventory across these various stores in Quickbooks.... well, forget about it. What a nightmare and complete time suck.<br /><br />Xero is a breeze to configure, use, and most importantly, implement. Don't get me wrong, you will spend some time importing your historical data into Xero. Most of my transactions consisted of PayPal, bank account, and AmEx charges.<br /><br />I completely trashed all my accounting transactions for 2015 in Quickbooks and started from scratch in Xero.<br /><br />You do NOT need to do this! They offer an import feature if you need to import your Quickbooks file.<br /><br />I wanted a fresh start. So I decided to really learn Xero by beginning from scratch. It was the best way to learn for me.<br /><br />For those of you on Shopify and Amazon (my platforms), I highly recommend you use Stitchlabs to sync it all, then set up and connect Xero to Stitchlabs.<br /><br />Your life will be so much better!<br /><br />Mine is.<br /><br />Now how do I break this news to my accountant...	2015-07-11

I liked that I could buy a cheaper one license version, as I only need it on my PC at work.  I have never gotten a virus with Norton.

I have to say that I am very unimpressed with Quicken. I have been using it for many years (can you say DOS) and the latest two updates have been horrible. With this version the product loses connection to bank account and credit cards I've had for years, and when trying to reset the account to clear the error, it goes into never-never land. Have to use the task manager to shut it down. This happens at least once a month. Intuit support? Forget it. Might be time to jump to another platform. Quicken has really lost its edge, if you ask me.	2015-07-11

Recipes are as important to me as photographs of family, and I have saved everything for my children and grandchildren.  I purchased Cook'n when I was running Windows, and am now an Apple person, with a MAC, IPad, and IPhone.  So, I have used Cook'n through many Updates, and I must say, they are serious about being the best at Cooking Recipes, and even though I have had issues in the past, their Technical Department has always taken care of me.  Lately, with the new Version, I worked with a Technician that helped me resolve the issue in no time.  Since I was a Baker in my last profession, I value my recipes, and have about 5 personal, printed recipe books, and can share a recipe with anyone.  In the past it was time consuming, BUT NOW, 2 clicks and the recipe is sent, in a beautiful format.  The accessibility to use my recipe in my kitchen, by just opening my IPad is the best use of my time, as I no longer have to search my books.  What I love the best now, and we all have evolved into INTERNET users, is how we can search the internet, find a recipe we like, capture it and put it into our Personal Cook Book, and save it, especially if it turns out to be a 5 Star Recipe.  Cook'n is the perfect organizer for us all who Use, Save, and Share Recipes for our Family and Friends, and I highly recommend it.  Thank you Dan for creating this tool.	2015-07-11

Otherwise deal with lawyers, don't buy $300-$600 living trust packages of documents from strangers (companies without attorneys). The basic packages will be more or less the same as created by this software, but you will pay 8-15 times more.  Thank you, Nolo!	2015-07-10

Replacing Norton 360 with Norton Security was not a great deal.  Most of the same features but no backup.  And there is not any price break for Security to get Backup.  You have to buy 10 copies, which I do not need.  Also, the clock starts running when you first install Security and applies to all other copies regardless of when you install them, unlike 360, which started the clock when each copy was installed.  Another complaint is when you upgrade to Security from 360, any remaining days left on 360 are not added to the time remaining on Security.	2015-07-10

I purchased it and did the upgrade because Intuit no longer supported the older version.  It changed two of my bank routing numbers and it won't allow me to correct them.  Then one of my bank account, it asks if I have changed the acct number, You say no and it resets it but it happens every time I do an update.<br />Somehow, I will manage to get through the next three years before Intuit wants me to upgrade again.  I will be searching for another software to replace intuit before then.<br />There is no support for this product so do not buy it.	2015-07-10

I am very happy with the Quicken Deluxe 2015 PC software. It was easy to download, install, and the setup was fairly intuitive.  Figuring out the budgeting system and loan took a little more time but I had an accurate snapshot of my checking account quickly.  The software does not connect to my Wells Fargo 401k account automatically.  I suspect that may be an issue on the Wells Fargo side though.  It tracks loan balances and asset amounts based on linked payments and is excellent at letting me know where my money is going.<br />I am not at all impressed with the Android companion software for Quicken 2015.  It is very lacking in features and the most important part - knowing how much money you have left after all bills are paid - is not available.  It just shows you how much is in your bank account at the moment.  If I wanted to view that I would use my bank's application. In order to see how much money you have left you will need to login to the computer that has Quicken loaded.  Definitely a disappointment. My husband would be more involved in the budgeting system if the Android companion app was better. Would be nice to have an accurate ending balance on the phone and the ability to take a snapshot of a receipt, tag it and assign it to an account rather than having to login to the PC to make individual entries later.	2015-07-10

I was shocked that Quicken wasn't available when I switched over.  During that year I tried iBank and Moneydance.  I wasn't real pleased so was always on the lookout for something better.  I was real happy when Quicken for Mac 2015 came out.<br /><br />I have been using it since September 2014.  I ran Quicken and IBank 5 in parallel from October through December of 2014 to determine which I liked better.  I picked Quicken.  No, it isn't as good as the version I was running on Microsoft in 2013, but:<br /><br />- The interface is superior to iBank every way<br />- Ease of use is superior to iBank in every way (the ease of reconciliation is a perfect example - it is a nightmare on iBank)<br />- iBank's better investment portfolio tools did not matter to me<br />- I did not need the broader reporting capability that iBank provides (I just want reports to support my itemized tax return and these are fine)<br /><br />Rather than converting my iBank files, I decided to start fresh with the new year.  Part of the reason for this is that migrating old files is not easy.<br /><br />I have been very happy.  No issues in downloading transactions from my financial institutions or otherwise.<br /><br />If you are a basic user (track income, expenses, download financial statements, manage budgets, report for tax purposes), Quicken is the best of what is available.  If your needs are greater or you really need all of the advanced features that are available in Windows versions, then you will probably be complaining and may want to look at iBank.	2015-07-10

F-Secure is more affordable if you don't need a lot of extra bells and whistles.<br /><br />It's banking protection is solid with only drawback, you can't add any bank websites if F-Secure banking protection can't pick them up. The browsing protection is solid and for those who aren't tech savvy can use F-Secure Safe Search to browse safely for those who do a lot web searching and trying to avoid sketchy sites.

Product seems to help with some Windows 8.1 issues, but just found out that my &#34;1-year&#34; license expired after only 7 months.  According to AVG Sales Support, this software was sold to a third party (Amazon Digital Serviced, Inc.) in April of 2014 and that is when the license year began, NOT in September, 2014 when Amazon sold it to me.  BEWARE of 3rd party software purchases.  I spoke with Amazon and they were already working with AVG to solve this problem that has affected others.  Amazon was very accomodating and has given me a credit that was more than I had paid for the software.	2015-07-09

But, as soon as the computer is idle for about 20 minutes, the computer spontaneously restarts.  It is a complete windows crash.  Kept happening every time the system was idle for about 20 minutes.  After trying numerous things, I isolated it to Norton.  Uninstalled Norton and no more problems.  I wasted my money on this and now need to buy something else.  Update: My initial review was installed on Win8.1.  Despite the previous edition (branded NIS) having no problems, Norton Security crashed my system non-stop.  I uninstalled and the problems went away.  Later, I upgraded to Windows 10 and decided to try this again.  So far, Norton Security is working without problems, at least none that I can pin on Norton.  Changing rating to 3 stars.  This product should work on Win 10, but beware if you are using an earlier version of Windows.	2015-07-09

This review is from: DVO Enterprises Cook'n Recipe Organizer, Version 11<br />This is the second recipe software product I have owned, the first being Living Cookbook which I could no longer use when we changed over to Apple. It took me a little while to figure out how to use Cook'n, not because it's that complicated, but because I am not very computer savvy. I have, however, become very fond of Cook'n. I now find it truly easy and fun to use, and when I've had a problem, customer service and Tech support have been there to help. It syncs my recipes on my Mac Pro, iPad and iPhone. If you buy this product, I would suggest you also sign up for Cook'n Club as it is a great learning tool.	2015-07-09

Activated the payroll with no issues, did have to update my credit card due to different charge date. Already knew about the $2.00 per month per employee charge as had to do that with 2014 version. It still comes out cheaper than buying the old enhanced payroll for more than 3 employees when you only have 4 or 5 employees.	2015-07-09

It also has very a limited reports function (e.g. can't see how my net worth changes from month to month based on the fluctuation in my various investments because the program can't make such reports).  For me, an absolute, unequivocal waste of money.  I bought it because I recently switched from PC to Mac.  But fortunately (?), I did keep my PC. So, when I realized how screwed up this Quicken for Mac program was, I got the Quicken  2015 upgrade(?) for my PC so I could continue to enjoy all the functionality of Quicken I had come to appreciate.  At which point, frustration mounted upon frustration and took me for a ride.  For one thing, Quicken 2015 for PC can't learn categories.  For example, Safeway and City Market (obviously grocery stores) continue to be listed as Personal Care instead of Groceries (so far, can't change it).  My Electric Utility Bill, continues to be categorized as Insurance (so far,can't change it). And I can't switch back to my very useful Quicken 2012 version because Quicken has removed the financial institution download function unless you upgrade (?).  Now I have to go back a whole year and recategorize quacky Quicken's recategorization of my spending.  What a flipping' zoo Intuit has become.	2015-07-09

I did all my research, read all the reviews, including the one on PCMag which gave Webroot its Editor's Choice Award.  Then, the minute I downloaded this software, the nightmare began.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that I wish I could crawl into a time machine and set the dial for the exact moment in time prior to my purchase of Webroot.  Barring this, no other way exists for me to ever retrieve the wasted hours of my life I spent dealing with this program -- not to mention the time I am now spending writing this magnum opus painstakingly detailing my nightmarish journey.  That time is gone forever.  The only thing I can do is warn others of my experience.  Hopefully someone will benefit from my pain.<br /><br />I strongly caution anyone against purchasing this program unless you have an extremely strong constitution coupled with the patience of Mother Theresa.  If that is you, I wish you Godspeed.  Just don’t neglect to gird your loins in preparation for the uphill battle that awaits you.<br /><br />COMPUTER SLOWDOWNS AND FREQUENT CRASHES:  Not long after downloading this program, my computer slowed down, and I noticed delays between my keyboard and mouse and my computer.  My computer kept freezing up and I could not unfreeze it via the task manager because the cursor was frozen, as well, so I had to perform hard shutdowns.  Then I would reboot my computer and the same thing would happen again.  Although my computer (six years old) would occasionally freeze or stop responding, after downloading Webroot, the change was profound.  It was happening so often I could get nothing done.<br /><br />WEBROOT’S RESPONSE:  I called Webroot and spoke to an extremely surly tech who sounded like I had just awoken him from a nap.  I had to ask him to speak up because he spoke in a barely audible mumble  that clearly conveyed I was inconveniencing him by my call.  My questions would be met by absolute silence -- not just the brief pause one would expect from someone preparing to deliver a thoughtful response -- but more like the Silence of the Lambs – silences so profound and prolonged that I was forced to ask him if he were still on the line.  He told me Webroot wasn’t the cause and that it must be my computer.  Following my conversation with him, I did some online research and found lots of reviews by people who reported the same issue, so it couldn’t have just been my computer out of millions.  Too bad I hadn’t done that beforehand, instead of relying on the “experts.”<br /><br />FAILED TO BLOCK MALICIOUS PROGRAM FROM DOWNLOADING ONTO MY COMPUTER:  I went to a website that had free software and accidentally downloaded a program that turned out to be malware.  I didn’t intend to download this program.  I may have inadvertently clicked on something.  I don’t know.  But somehow it began downloading and running on my computer and I couldn’t stop it.  I went to the control panel and attempted to delete the program, but it would not let me do so.  Instead, it would ask me if I would allow it to make changes to my computer.  I was forced to say yes hoping the “changes” it intended to make were to uninstall it, but of course that wasn’t the case.  It probably just downloaded more crap and poured more and more malicious code onto my system.  Now, mind you, all this it did WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A MURMUR OF PROTEST FROM WEBROOT!!  Contrary to its own documentation (available online) which states that in the event Webroot encounters a suspicious program, it will prompt the user and warn against downloading anything from that site.  Barring that, if Webroot fails to block the virus or malicious program from breaching its security, it is supposed to recognize and quarantine the program so that it doesn’t then go on a rampage, raping and pillaging everything in its path.  In my case, none of the above occurred.  On the contrary, the program downloaded without a hitch.  Afterwards, my system began freezing and crashing like crazy.  And if I thought things had been  bad before, I was grossly mistaken.  Finally, the problem was resolved by my operating system and not by Webroot.  My operating system intervened when I had booted it up for the umpteenth time and ran Check Disk.  I watched as Check Disk ran and read what it was doing.  It was deleting corrupt files, and checking security descriptors.  At one point through all of this, Webroot flashed a notice that it had “removed  a threat.”  Really Webroot?  Not a moment too soon.  Like some fat, lazy security guard who ambles onto the scene of a crime after a civilian bystander has taken down the thug.  Thanks a lot.<br /><br />WEBROOTS’S RESPONSE:  Webroot said that it cannot block all programs from downloading because people call them and complain that programs they specifically want to download are blocked.<br /><br />PASSWORD MANAGER PROBLEMS FROM HERE TO DOOMSDAY:  First, the password manager extension didn't appear on my toolbar.  Spoke to someone in tech support who was very nice and helped me to fix it.  Called again because I was trying to use the password manager and it wouldn't work with a lot of the websites I tried to save.  Initially I thought it was me because I'm not very computer-savvy.  So I went over everything with the tech (who was also very nice) and he walked me through everything until I was sure I understood how to use it.  Then, when I tried working with it on my own, I found out what a horrendous, buggy program it is.  I saved dozens of sites to the password manager that seemed to be working fine.  Then when I would later go and click on them, Webroot would react strangely, sometimes taking me to the site and not filling in the login and password, sometimes only filling in part of the password, etc.  I tried re-saving the login/password info for these sites numerous times. I literally spent hours doing this. The password manager would say it detected a change in the password and when I clicked on confirm, it would either just capture the first character of the new password, or run okay but continue to prompt me that it detected a change in the password every time I logged onto that site.  There were at also numerous sites that I couldn't even get the password manager to work with at all, despite trying again and again, ad nauseam.<br /><br />WEBROOT’S RESPONSE:  I was told by one person in sales/customer support that he used the password manager on his own computer all the time and that it worked great.  He referred me to the online documentation, which I assured him I had already read.  By that point, I was all too familiar with the ins and outs of the password manager feature.  He still found this difficult to believe.  Next I spoke to tech support and was told basically the same thing, that it could not be Webroot that was at fault, but that I must be doing something wrong.  He said that Webroot is the number one software on the market, so I guess then it couldn’t be them.  I invited him to remotely access my computer and check it out for himself.  When he did so, he was surprised that, indeed, things weren’t working so great.  He then proceeded to tell me it must be my computer that wasn’t working well.  I asked him what could possibly be happening on my computer that would cause an internet toolbar extension to malfunction?  He threw  out a few ideas, like maybe I had hardware issues, or another program was interfering with the password manager.  I invited him to look at my programs and see if he could find something that might be conflicting with Webroot and he could not.  NOTE:  Afterwards, I read reviews by others who were treated in like manner.  Apparently Webroot has the attitude that it’s product is perfect and that if the user encounters problems with its software, it must be their fault.<br /><br />ATTEMPT TO GET A REFUND:  Since I purchased this product on Amazon, I was unable to get a refundbecause of Amazon’s policy.  I told Webroot that I wanted a refund from them and was told they couldn’t do so because I hadn’t purchased the product from them.  But surely they had sold the product to Amazon who then sold it to me, right?  So in essence they did sell me the program.  At any rate, I was so disgusted I just wanted to get rid of the damn thing.<br /><br />MY LAST CONTACT WITH WEBROOT:  I grew finally frustrated with one tech and asked to be connected to a supervisor.  I waited and waited.  The line rang, and I thought the supervisor was going to pick up.  Instead, I HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO SOMEBODY’S VOICEMAIL!!  I was livid.  I talked to yet another tech and was again told I couldn’t get a refund.  After he had been dealing with me for awhile which, granted, could not have been pleasant by that point, he threw out that I could just get a refund.  When I said that I had been told that was not possible, he insisted that it was.  So conflicting information on top of everything else.  At that point, it was just the icing on the cake.  He told me the my issues about the password manager would be “escalated” to another tech support department who would check on things “from the back end.”  They were supposed to email me the results of their findings by today.  As of this writing, I have heard nothing from them except an email telling me they were going to look into it.  Great.  I was told over the phone that they would have already looked into it by today and gotten back to me.  Buyer beware.	2015-07-09

Check the VB100 yourself and see what misrepresentations this company makes	PC-Matic continues it's lying deceptive commercials that it is the #1 on the VB100 Rap Sheet. Google it and read it yourself. Although they do protect from viruses they are listed as Buggy in the results table for 2015 and as a higher then normal user of resources which their commercial declares, &#34;PC Matic doesn't have the overhead of all the foreign Anti Virus products&#34;. Then look through the full reports on the VB website and notice that in the past three years PC-Matic has blown VBs on certain still updated windows platforms. I invite to look at the VB100 (google it) as this is the source they are quoting incorrectly and are flagrantly saying they were at the top which never occured. I'm not saying it's not a bad deal but for real security, do you want to trust a company with such deceptive ad's? In closing the VB100 is the best place to go top see how your exact operating system will perform. By the way PC Matic changed to PC Pitsop / PC Matic on the VB. No clue about that.	2015-07-08

There are just some things in Paintshop that Photoshop doesn't have (and visa versa).  As a newer photographer, Photoshop is more for the advance user.  Paintshop is for the everyday user at home and it is easier to figure out than Photoshop is.  When I got my Paintshop, it came with Facefilter...not necessary, but was really fun to play with.  It's a program that gives makeup/makeovers for photos a boost.  I had a photo where a girl looked like she had bruises around her eyes.  She was very blonde so you could not see her brows.  In Facefilter, I was able to add realistic looking brows and in Paintshop I used the makeup touchup tool to get the bruises out from her eyes--the photo looked MUCH better with those touch ups.  I highly recommend this software and for the price, you just can't beat it (the Corel site still sells it for almost $80).	2015-07-08

Just sad.	Doesn't have a sync.  I've read a lot of other issues with basic functionality and connectivity but I didn't experience those.  However, a cloud solution that doesn't have a sync option is pointless.  Everyone else has it, and doing what everyone else does is the bare minimum in any product.  Not what I would expect from the largest cloud provider, except that the cloud services always have some truck-drivable holes. I get 1TB from Google for $120/year.  I have 350GB of photos, and prefer to keep two copies in case I accidentally change or delete in my working directory. It would be nice to archive all my other various and sundry files (such as my old Technet subscription ISOs) so I was very excited about unlimited from a first tier provider of cloud services. I expected all the functionality of the file backup folks like Dropbox, Carbonite, Backblaze, etc. plus the bandwidth of Amazon.  Maybe even some on-line redundancy, geographical separation, etc. Instead I got a product that's like an electric car with a crank instead of a plug.  The largest on-line retailer in the world, with an incredibly high tech distribution center with 100 foot tall automatic product retrieval machines feels that backups of my info (which is important enough that I'm paying for it) should involve a manual process.  I am stunned.	2015-07-08

I experienced minimal, what I call &#34;looping&#34; errors, in which tax software asks you to provide some basically irrelevant information during error checking that should have been automatically adjusted but a change you made threw that automatic adjustment out of whack. So you keep getting asked for information out of context but the interface and help sections cannot tell you how to answer. It is usually like, &#34;On line 45 of section 3, you entered '0'; this cannot be a '0.' Enter the correct number of insignificant manifestations now.&#34;<br /><br />All tax programs claim to give guidance, but the help sections are often limited. H&R Block software seems more limited than others I have used and about the same in terms of organization and ease of use.

It was great at first - easy to use, reasonably priced. But recently it has become difficult to like this software and Intuit itself. Each year they have a new, money-grabbing tactic; abandoning version support, forced, costly upgrades, charging per employee, limiting installs. Now, I am starting an additional business with only two employees. I have been researching using Quickbooks with Payroll, but after reading the reviews here and on the Costco website, I will not be purchasing it. I called Quickbooks directly to ask questions, but the hold time was endless and when I finally reached someone, their English was so poor it was difficult to ask questions and understand answers. I did, however, gather that it would be expensive for me to implement the software for my minimum needs. I suspect that both the on-line and physical versions with payroll include additional and hidden charges that would make using this prohibitively expensive for me, and it is clear the company is migrating to on-line only, so purchasing the physical software is likely to be a waste of money when they abandon that version. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INNOVATIVE INTUIT SOFTWARE COMPANY? I can recall years ago thinking I should invest in Intuit because their products and service were unique and superior to others, but obviously that is no longer true. I will be purchasing a competitor product. Sad.	2015-07-07

So simple and lightweight	This is an amazing recorder. So simple and lightweight. Very light on resources and does the job very well. I tested it on GTA V which runs ~60FPS for me and recording brought it down to 45-50FPS range but it's not bad at all considering how heavy on resource a game like GTA V can be. Also tried many other games and most games played and recorded above 60FPS which is a very good thing imo.  I've used Fraps, Dxtory and many others in the past but this one definetely is much better. No complicated stuff just press a button to start recording and when finished press the button again. The videos come out to be very crisp and smooth.  Plenty of options if you wanna configure stuff. You can adjust the resolution and quality of the video so you don't have massive files which take forever to upload to youtube etc.  Haven't tried twitch tv broadcasting as i don't have a fast enough upload to use it it anyways.  Conclusion: If you record videos frequently, this software is an improvement over others i've tried. It should help you a lot.	2015-07-07

I have backed up the files	Loyal Quicken customer since 2000, seriously thinking of moving to another program.  The bugs in this version is beyond frustrating.  After four months of using it, I finally called the customer service in May, and after doing everything I was advised to do, the &#34;fixes&#34; only lasted for a week.<br /><br />Issues:<br />- the keyboard mappings for using Window's standard shortcuts (copy/paste/cut) has to be reset every.single.time. you open Quicken.  Even though it says the Window's option is selected the shortcuts do not work, instead I have to select &#34;Quicken standard&#34; then close the program, reo-open and choose &#34;Window's standard,&#34; close then open again and then it works.<br /><br />- I can no longer connect to the Cloud and ultimately sync it with Quicken Mobile which was the reason I upgraded to Quicken 2015 in the first place.  If I connect and sync, the next time I open up Quicken it says my password is incorrect.  I try opening up a backed up version but I can only open up a version that dates back two months.  That is two months worth of input that has to be re-done, think about that - not fun!<br /><br />I have backed up the files, uninstalled Quicken and re-installed.  Same errors persist.  Not acceptable.  I hope the files are backward compatible, I might just permanently uninstall 2015 and use 2012 instead - hopefully without the syncing and mobile options these issues will go away.<br /><br />Intuit, you had a very satisfied 15-year Quicken and Intuit customer in me.  If these issues persist I have no choice but to explore other software.	2015-07-07

I was using Quicken Essentials for the Mac and bought this new version last year thinking it would run on Snow Leopard, but it didn't.  I finally updated to Mountain Lion and decided to &#34;go for the gusto&#34;.<br /><br />First off, it requires that you logon to Intuit's website before it will let you have access to your converted  data. This was confusing to me because the installer never explained why I had to logon.  When I got to the site it didn't really do anything except something with Mobile App.  So, I did it and then I was able to get to my data file.  If I tried to skip this step it closed my converted data file.  (FYI, I was also using Intuit's online Chat for help, but they really weren't much help. They never were able to explain why I had to logon just to convert my data.  And when I asked they couldn't tell me where my data was stored ). Based on the way this works, someone without network access wouldn't even be<br />able to convert their data at all.<br /><br />I also keep copies of past years in a separate data files and I wanted to convert these so they would be up to date and usable with this software. The installer took me through the steps again, and again forced me to logon to Intuit.  Come on! I already did this!  Why can't you just convert my files and let me start working with the program?  (I kind of wonder why they did this and did they take a copy of my financial data without my knowledge.)<br /><br />Then I tried to find my newly converted data file, just because I like to know where my data is located on my Mac.  I had to get a techie  to find it because it's now stored in Library under Application Support (and Library is hidden under Mountain Lion, unlike Snow Leopard). I would rather have it prompt me for a location.  Plus, when I found my data file I actually discovered 3 other copies from previous conversion attempts.<br /><br />After all that I was able to get to my data without any problems.  Now I'm just getting used to the new layout, etc.	2015-07-07

This tells me that Norton itself has been compromised and if you rely on it's results, you are likely to get a virus.

I'm giving this one star because TT has eliminated the Cost Basis Lookup Tool, necessary to compile one's investment costt basis. In the help forums, they actually recommend that one take the hours it would take and compile it by hand, a la prior to the age of computers.<br /><br />https://ttlc.intuit.com/questions/2757203-cost-basis-lookup-tool<br /><br />In their reviews, people have been complaining how many have been now forced into upgrading to the Premier version from the Deluxe, but the Premier Version also does not do what it has in the past, and worst of all, TT offers No upgrade or alternative. The Premier Version no longer handles one's Investments as it was specifical lydesigned for, and did in the past.<br /><br /> As of 2014, The Cost Basis Lookup Tool has been removed!  This was apparently a subscription service, Gainskeeper, that Turbo Tax used so that at the flick of a button one's cost basis for investments held for many years  could be calculated taking into account reinvested dividends, stock splits, etc.  No where is this admitted to; one finds it out as you fumble and fumble with the software.  I finally called TT.  Their support has not been told about this, but with the 3rd person I talked to, he compared screens for 2013 vs 2014 and found that 2014 no longer has the Cost Basis determination connection button.  TT uses the Very disingenuous reason that they've done this because starting in 2012, investment companies have to keep this information for investments made starting in 2012.  For those many many of us who need it the most, having investments that go back well prior to 2012....TT suggests....and get this.....that you research it out, going back to investment houses you many no longer use or may no longer be in business and figure the cost basis, with  dividends, stock splits, etc., by hand!<br /><br />This is a terrible disservice, obviously designed only to save them money, ignoring the very time consuming, if even possible, burden on the taxpayer.  I don't know other options, but the third person I finally spoke to at TT  knew, not from TT to benefit the customer, but by happenstance, that the company TT had contracted with was Gainskeeper and apparently one can get a subscription (at the cost of more than the total cost of TT Premier) to figure one's investment cost basis.  And wasn't that what Premier was specifically designed for, investments?  So the Gouging is not only at the Deluxe level, but all levels. Given bad options,  I would gladly pay extra to reinstate this option. And, given these changes from quality to gouging for profit, I'd expect more bad news in the future, so disappointing.	2015-07-07

Sometimes it pays to heed negative reviews even if they make up just 7% of the total reviews.<br /><br />I downloaded this security software about an hour ago.  Unfortunately, it will not allow me to log into my account.  Instead, I received an error message saying my email address was &#34;unknown.&#34;  However, this is the same email address Webroot used to send me a confirmation email.  We are off to a rocky start!<br /><br />I was reluctant to purchase the program because of complaints about poor customer service.  A pleasant sounding gentleman named &#34;James&#34; has apologetically responded to almost all the negative Amazon reviews.  I messaged him about this issue.  I will let you know if kind, responsive, James offers any real assistance.<br /><br />So until I actually receive some customer service, I can only give this product 2 Stars.<br /><br />Update:  7-7-15, 5:41 CST<br />Kind, responsive James responded to my email within an hour.  He gave me clear and concise instructions that worked!  I therefore happily upgrade my review to 5 stars.<br /><br />Good customer service means everything to me.  Thank you James!	2015-07-07

I am not a novice when it comes to recipe programs since I have purchased five other programs in the last 20 years.

When I have had a problem the trouble shooters have performed like not other company and found a solution immediately like I was their only customer. This is very special service which is not found often. I have the program on a MAC OS-X which is my main computer for making my cookbook but had to put it on my PC because my wife wanted to check all my work and could not use the MAC. It has great 'themes' for all interest and when you email a recipe to someone, it looks just like it does on your computer.	2015-07-07

There is no better way to organize recipes.  Before Cook'n, I would copy recipes on letter size sheets and stored the in three 3&#34; loose leaf notebooks. I do menus two weeks at a time and finding what I wanted was a nightmare. Now everything is on my computer (iMac 27). I quickly scan the contents of my cookbooks in Cook'n, or I can search for recipes with  particular ingredients. I decide on the meals and then schedule them on my calendar app and print out the calendar. The best thing is that you don't need to print out any recipes. I have the iPhone and iPad apps so I just bring the recipe up on my iPad, put on the stand and use it right in the kitchen. All of these devices sync with the Cook'n cloud so you have your recipes wherever you go. Recently we rented a cabin in a state park and cooked the entire time out of the recipes available on my iPad.<br /><br />Finally, I want note their strong customer support. I have been using this software for over a year now and as updates have occurred in both Cook'n and my devices, a couple of issues arose. I emailed customer support and within 24 hours, they replied and resolved my issue. I would recommend Cook'n to anyone.	2015-07-06

I waited a few weeks after buying this to write the review since most software updates take a while for me to get used to.  After 3 weeks I still hate this.  The only reason I bought it is because they stop the auto-update capability after a couple years, of course Intuit knows this and they force your hand at buying their new release.  I wish they'd just allow us to pay a bit more to renew the old version.  About 1/2 of my accounts that used to update seamlessly now have some glitch and I have to go in afterwards and fix errors.  It no longer recognizes regular inputs (like monthly dividends) and auto-fills the info, I now have to do that manually.  It's insisting many of my stock accts aren't matched, then attempts to remedy this and goes back in time to make adjustments, messing it all up and taking tons of time to figure out what it actually did.  I suppose if you have a simple portfolio this would work just fine, but it you have a number of investments at different brokerage acts, it's a disaster.

Malware bytes is great, but the website protection blocks certain types of peer to peer traffic. I have to disable the website protection to use any kind of p2p software. I purchased it for the actual antivirus, not the web protection so it's no big deal. I recommend disabling website protection and using a combination of adblock and common sense to avoid sketchy websites. Malware bytes is also becoming pretty popular, so I feel like it is becoming less effective as viruses are written to avoid it's detection. It never hurts to run one time scans from other antivirus providers to be more thorough.	2015-07-06

The program will not maintain links to online checking and credit card accounts.  When links are re-established per Intuit's instructions the software downloads months worth of transactions that need to be deleted manually, ONE BY ONE.  This has become beyond tedious.<br /><br />Please note:  You cannot talk to anyone at Quicken.  You cannot email them.  Online chat is useless.<br /><br />If I did not have my major banking activity with BoA I might think this program is OK.  I have been using Quicken for over 10 years.  However, if you bank with BoA and/or use one of their credit cards often, DO NOT expect Quicken 2015 to work well and DO NOT expect Intuit to care enough to fix this.  They clearly do not.	2015-07-06

I've used Turbotax for over 2o years.  2014 is the last year for me.  For the past 10 years I have owned a rental property in a foreign country and have prepared my taxes using Turbotax Deluxe.  This year I had to upgrade to the Home and Business version at a substantially higher price.  Strike One.  When I started to input my data on the rental property Turbotax software notified me that I had been claiming too much depreciation in past years and would have to file amended returns going back to 2010 as well as filing Form 3115 requesting IRS to allow me to change my depreciation method.  WTF???  I was relying on Turbotax to choose the appropriate depreciation method since I had inputted the fact that the property is in a foreign country and also provided the Canadian address.  Apparently turbotax has been miscalculating depreciation for the past 10 years despite the input data being correct.  Strike Two.  Now I have to do a lot of refiling and may incur penalties and interest (which, I assume Turbotax will pay) but even if I am held harmless the amount of time and effort spent, plus having to hire a CPA to fill out the form (Turbotax has not offered to provide any assistance with Form 3115, nor to pay the CPA's fee) it is still going to cost me big time.  Strike Three!  I am not the only person that has been burned on this depreciation issue.  The Turbotax community website is filled with similar stories.  My guess is that there will be a class action suit against Intuit over this.  They can count me in.	2015-07-06

However, unable to open program and complete installation. Initially contacted AMAZON for assistance and was referred to Adobe. However, Adobe does not provide either phone or on-line chat support for this product. Adobe basically provides a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) type of support for this product which deals with software installation errors. However, I never even got to installation error messages or a screen to enter my software keys/serial numbers. It would appear that the actual file for installing the software after downloading it from Amazon is missing. Finally went back to Amazon for phone support and &#34;met&#34; Bryan who speculated the download was perhaps not compatible with the latest Apple OS revision. After requesting he agreed to a full refund, which they normally don't provide for downloaded digital products. Refund received promptly. Amazon support was okay in that they refunded my purchase price. Adobe support is non-existant for this product	2015-07-06

That disappears after about a week or two, and then they would just LOVE to hear your voice instead! You can find the chat support again if you can find the magic path. I may as well include it here:<br /><br />Quickbooks Online Chat Support<br />Sign in to QuickBooks Online.<br />Click the Help (?) icon.<br />Click any link under Topics.<br />At the bottom, click the Contact us link.<br />Select the Contact us tab.<br />Under Get Connect, expand Call.<br />Click the Payroll Live Chat.<br /><br />In addition to my super fun time doing data entry and my taxes going out late because i couldn't make some numbers match.... Intuit thought, no... no, there is more fun to be had.... How about we bill you AGAIN for an annual license even though you bought one on amazon?<br /><br />Oh, you think that's enough? NOPE! How about $27 fee for sending out your payroll! WOOOHOOO!<br /><br />I wish I could send Intuit a bill for my hourly rate of all the time I wasted trying to convert to this product. It is absolutely 100% grade A manure.<br /><br />Unless you're my competition, if you are, please move to quickbooks online. While you're trying to figure that out, I'll be happy to spend time working rather than using their tragic software.	2015-07-06

Enjoyed that it would leave me alone and did what it was supposed to do. Easily programmable and not to difficult to navigate. Recently Norton had issued an update to their software which for some reason had it deleting all my steam games and mods downloaded from Nexus/Steam Workshop. It even attempted to delete the steam overlay. I have over 200 quarantined .exe files that had no threats of any kind. Games like Half Life 2, the entire Fallout series, Warframe, and BattleBlock Theater had been labeled as hazards then were removed without any warning. In order to get them back I will have to remove them one by one out of quarantine and set Norton to ignore them. I imagine I would have to go into Norton and approve every new game installed if I continued with them. Luckily my time with Norton is ending soon so I can easily change services.	2015-07-06

You get what you pay for - and for the price, it is good enough. Its $12/year for unlimited BACKUP of photos, including raw. It is not meant to be a live synced drive like OneDrive, Dropbox etc. Contrary to some other comments here, you are able download an entire subfolder, and it comes in as a AmazonCloudDrive.zip file containing the stuff you selected. Also, you can access all the photos and sync using the tablet app, which is what most people do to show their holiday photos etc. (iClould free storage would be too small to have every file at random access).  You should consider the data as COLD DATA to be retrieved in case your local HDD goes kaput or you accidentally deleted something. Saying that though, unlike Amazon's 'Glacial Storage', you actually do have live access to every individual file. I've got over 1TB of photos/videos - probably 80% are raw file photos and jpegs. The rest videos (that are not part of the unlimited deal) So for $12/year to put this into a 99.999% availability offsite cloud storage, its good enough or else, I'll have buy more and more hard disks.  Your workflow could be 1) Take pictures 2) Download to your pc 3) Upload all to cloud first 4) Then work off your raw files. 5) Share/show across all tablets using the tablet app.  With that in mind, the big CON is there's no Explorer / external client to access the files - it is all done via web browser, or tablet app. The problem with this is I cannot sort or select files if I had a more 'normal' client.	2015-07-05

For example, I've owned quickbooks pro for a number of years, and always upgrade after 2-3 years (the most recent version I've owned is quickbooks pro 2014). With quickbooks online, you have to pay a monthly (or yearly if you choose) subscription price, where as the desktop version is yours to own forever. The amazon price is good for a year only, but after that you'll be at the mercy of intuit's price However, if you believe you'll upgrade every year anyways then it might be worth it. Looking beyond pricing, here are the features I've found most useful in quickbooks online:<br /><br />1. It lives on the cloud: It allows me to work in the office & at home, without lugging my laptop around (this was what I used to do when I had the desktop version). With quickbooks online, you can access your company file from any computer with an internet connection (and there is no software to install). This also means your data is backed up and safe every time.<br /><br />2. Mobile App: Quickbooks online also has a mobile app that can be downloaded for your iPhone (not sure about android or windows). While I believe the iPhone app is still a little basic, it does help me save time. For example, if I'm in the field and I incur an expense (i.e. we buy our workers lunch) I can take a picture of the receipt, enter the amount, payee, select what kind of expense it was from my chart of accounts, assign the expense to a class (I make heavy use of the class tracking feature because it lets me track income for each of my rental properties separately). After I click done, the expense posts right away (which means I don't have to save the receipt and enter it when I'm in front of a computer.<br /><br />3. I save time entering transactions: I have my checking & credit card accounts connected to it. Quickbooks makes matching transactions that you've entered to a bank or credit card charge a snap. For example, ifI buy food using my credit card and enter the expense either through my phone or the computer, quick books will let you match that transaction to the charge on your credit card statement. This makes reconciliation go by much much faster.<br /><br />Overall: If you own quickbooks pro desktop and are considering upgrading, I'd strongly suggest you use the thirty day trial intuit offers to setup a sample company and play around with it. A lot of the features & terms are the same as quickbooks desktop, however the layout is a little bit different and you do have to play with the settings to make it suit your custom needs.<br />If you've never owned quickbooks before, then I would recommend the online version. My review is for quickbooks online plus, but you're needs might be met by quickbooks online simple start or essentials which are a little cheaper. Intuit has a comparison chart so you can see which edition has the features you need.	2015-07-05
US	52288509	R1BFK93O1ZE8LY	B00MHZ6VHM	189160898	Norton Security for One Device	Digital_Software	3	0	0	N	N	I had used Norton 360 for several years and liked it. I had no problems while using it	I had used Norton 360 for several years and liked it. I had no problems while using it. I bought a new computer 2 weeks ago. I downloaded Norton Security without problems. I like the way it performs continuous scans in the background and gives indicators of whether websites are safe. However, a malware program got onto my new computer that called itself &#34;cassopesia&#34; (I am not sure of the spelling). It was a pseudo Internet search engine that would launch itself whenever I tried to use Internet Explorer or Firefox. The malware did not cause any harm to my computer, but it prevented me from using the browsers I wanted to use. It also allowed countless ads to appear on my computer, even though I had installed Adblock for both IE and Firefox. Norton Security did not detect that the program was on the computer. I called the 800 number for customer service. Apparently, Norton has farmed out its customer service to a third party. Even though I had just paid for the program, I was told I would be charged $249.99 to have the malware (that Norton Security missed) removed from my computer. I felt I had no choice because the computer was unusable as it was and I had to access the Internet to work on a project for work that was due that night. I was told that the fee would include a free year of Norton Security. The customer service representative that assisted me used two freeware malware removal programs and never did remove the malware or 2 other programs (adware) that had installed themselves. He was able to get IE and Firefox to work, although he admitted that &#34;cassopesia&#34; was still on my computer. I was able to complete my project that night and meet my deadline for work. I then had time to research malware removal programs the next day. I found online reviews that stated that Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is the best program of its type. There is a free version that just scans when you ask it to; it then removes the malware that it found. The commercial version will scan continuously in the background and alert you if malware is detected. It will then remove the malware. I downloaded the freeeware version and ran a scan. It immediately found the &#34;cassopesia&#34; malware that the 2 programs that Norton Security Customer Service failed to detect. Malwarebytes removed that program as well as the 2 adware programs that Customer Service identified but could not remove. I am not saying not to buy Norton Security because it does do some things well. However, it also misses some malware, and its customer service practice comes close to extortion. I will continue to use it because I have almost 2 years of service paid for, but after that I will explore other options.  Addendum: 7/6/2015 I would like to upgrade my rating to 3 stars from 1 star. Apparently the program that downloaded itself onto my computer is called a Potentially Unwanted Program (PUP). Here is what Norton's customer service told me today: &#34;Potentially Unwanted Programs do not fall into the definition of harmful software; hence Norton does not detect those as a threat.&#34; Apparently I had a PUP on my computer that scammed me. Norton stated today that they do not charge for customer service. I would rate Norton Security higher than 3 stars if it detected and removed PUP's. The PUP apparently directed me to an 800 number connected to the PUP and not to Norton Security's customer service. Live and learn, I guess. Hopefully, this will help someone else.	2015-07-05

Once properly installed and operating it ran great and fast-I ran Parkdale speed test and it ran 10 times faster than my old Hard Drive (HD). Strangely I saw no difference in the window index experience but the computer was noticeably running faster.  This is my first rodeo with SSD but not with HD's. The first problem I ran into is that my computer OS(widow vista)did not recognized this drive so it makes the Acronis software difficult to run with this problem. I went on Youtube and found this is a basic problem with these SSD drives, any brand. Anyway I went to YouTube and watch this video- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3zSenz4m80 The fellow on this video explained this problem with a Samsung SSD drive and shows how to fix it by using the management features found on windows.  Once I got pass that I down located the free Acronis software per the instructions that the Adata gave. Well that downloaded software did not work. I wasted about 3 hours trying to do that. no dice, I went to Acronis website and down loaded the 14 day trial version of migration software. It down loaded fine and the software worked fine without using any codes and such. With the trial version I migrated my HD data to the SSD, no problem.  I used the 2nd HD slave space on my computer instead of the USB port to install the migrated data because I didn't have the cables and adapter to connect this SSD drive thru the USB port. It copied my main HD drive in about 20 minutes- sweet. I was replacing a 500 Gig drive with about 130 gigs of used space on it. I was expecting the migration software to fail but it worked okay. It transfer the data from larger Gig size HD to the smaller Gig sized SSD.  It should not be that hard to do, but it is. HD memory have always been a pain to install so SSD's are not any different. I spend about 8 hours messing with this drive by going to researching different web sites,watching different YouTube videos and just manipulating this drive. The next installation should take about 20 minutes or more. My suggestion to the Adata manufacture is that they should provide the instruction with a detailed video on YouTube for rookie like me-showing from unwrap to final operations including the drive manage features of window.  Anyway have fun. I used an old computer I had to test this SDD to see how it worked. It was worth the hassle. I have other newer computers I need to install SSD;s it will be snap to do now that I understand the procedure. Next time I will buy a SSD that comes with a kit with USB cables included for migrating my Lap top computer HD to the SSD. Asked the vender if this one should come with the USB cable adapter if you are upgrading your laptop or where you can get one.  Second purchase( 8 months later):: This time for my computer with a OS windows 7 and with a I,000 gig hard drive I bought this same drive again because it works and I thought it was going to be a piece of cake. How wrong I was The acronis software explained that it would require several boots to clone the drive. So I let it do it's thing. It didn't work properly. It copied the part with the operating system and finished there. It did not boot several times only once so it finished there with 30 gig formatted on that drive. I perform the same thing several times and the same thing happen. I went to the manage part of windows and viewed the SSD and it was split in two different Volumes. messed with the volume's.. I later found out I should have just extended the volume to attach them together. Somehow I thought I had lost 18 Gb of the SSD by messing with the volumes . So the SSD drive now has 238. shown in windows disk manger instead of 256 Gb. The bios still shows it has 238 Gb This was strange so I check several help blogs in the internet and found this is a normal size memory that windows lets you see for a 256 SSD  The missing 18 Gb is hidden doing some other work that the SSD needs to do. So I decide to go with that size memory.   I looked for another migration software and found one called Paragon Migrate OS to SSD 4.0 English. Paragon some bad reviews on amazon but I decided to give it a shot. It cost 20 buck for the password to unlock their down load. I selected the 64 bit version and used that. I installed that and used it. It worked like a charm. What I liked about this software is that it does not required you to reboot for the software to  do it's thing. A window appears and the progress is shown there. It does it's thing until it is complete. No reboots until the work is completed.  This is my main desktop computer and it works great now, again 10 times faster. This computer has a small power supply (220 watts). I check the load to see how that was. It normally draws about 77 watt at idle mode now with the SSD it is drawing  63 watts. So it used about 14 watt less. With use on different loads the 14 watts savings stay about the same.  I found that the paragon migration performed a better job that Acronis.In fact windows perform excellent using this software, The other computer that I used acronis- the windows is a little unstable when it boots and during operations I lose windows every so offend. It just a redundant old computer I have so it's not that important to me. It was having this problem on the original drive so it must have been an existing hardware or software problem. I just used this computer as a test platform so it's okay. So mission accomplished on the second drive using paragon software.  Next:  I will remount the first SSD I bought into my new laptop with windows 8.1. First I Migrated software using the CD port of the laptop to the SSD. Paragon migration worked fine. The SSD is now installed and running on my laptop. Missionaccomplished. Windows 8.1 is running as fast as windows 7 when using the mouse and keyboard. The touch screen is as fast as a Microsoft Surface Tablet. Sweet.   In conclusion- Paragon migration OS to SSD 4.O (English) software saved the day. I am glad I bought this product	2015-07-05

DO NOT BUY!<br />As a small business owner (multiple retail locations), I will make a conscious effort to write a pragmatic review to hopefully help others, but the 1st line sums it up.<br /><br />My top 2 complaints are 1. Price vs. value and 2. Memory usage.  I would gladly take my non-supported QB Pro 2012 back in a heartbeat.  After being forced to upgrade, I have quickly come to the realization that Intuit made some changes to the UI/appearance and added a few menu options, but that's about it.  This, combined with things like &#34;Online Banking&#34; which is now &#34;Bank Feeds&#34; that no longer work in the native (QB) application just degrade the return on investment.  I'll provide additional details later...<br /><br />Second, and this is a big deal: QB Pro 2015 is a SYSTEM HOG.  I'm not sure if it's all the background connections or just the software itself, but when I open QB, EVERYTHING on my laptop slows down to a crawl.  The only way to get everything back up and running is to force-close QB and restart.  My other latency complaint is that when you're working in QB, every mouse click and keystroke has a noticeable delay.  This makes ledger entries, adding transactions, editing transactions and just about everything else a headache.  I can honestly say that just due to the latency alone, it takes me about twice the amount of time to perform routine tasks vs. QB Pro 2012.  I've setup a lot of rules for adding transactions, but still have to manually add more than a handful each week... this has gone from quick and easy to beyond painful.<br /><br />Misc notes (based on what I've discovered so far):<br />-Bank Feeds (formerly Online Banking) does not work within the application, even if your accounts were imported from a previous version and setup.  I now have to visit each financial website (banking, credit card, etc.) via browser and download the file from there + import.  This 1. takes significant additional time and 2. completely defeats the purpose of setting up the capability within QB.<br />-The maddening yellow &#34;What's New&#34; pop-ups: I think I finally got them to go away, but these were irritating to say the least.  Most were duplicates (same screen) and again, added to the latency of the software by taking forever to clear.<br />-Payroll: I'll spare all the repeats, as enough feedback has already been written about the new payroll service.  We've switched providers and I encourage other small business owners to do the same.  Intuit's new payroll service and per-transaction pricing are ridiculous.  Read the fine print carefully, because even if you do all the work, there is still a per-check fee.<br /><br />My recommendation to those considering this software is DO NOT BUY.  There are alternatives out there and this will be our LAST Quickbooks purchase.  My recommendation to Intuit (for what it's worth) is to take a mulligan, punt, or whatever and chalk this release/edition up as a lesson learned.  There has to be a pricing model that makes sense to 1. remain on a prior version yet 2. provide subscription updates.	2015-07-05

I've used QuickBooks for 15 years and I've taught classes to help others learn it.  Having been a CPA now for 25 years, in my opinion QuickBooks is the single easiest and best accounting software ever made.  Mastering all the features and best practices of QuickBooks takes a little patience and collaboration with other good accountants who know the software well but once you understand how to use QuickBooks it is an enormous time saver.  If you're stuck with using some of the features try looking for videos on Youtube or take one of the classes on Lynda.com.  It may take you a year or more to learn how to get the best out of the software but it's well worth the investment.  As you read the negative comments here, please be cautious about making your decision based on what some are saying.  Every accountant I know loves QuickBooks and it's oftentimes the first and only software we want to use.	2015-07-04

BAD, VERY BAD, AND WORSE THAN VERY BAD PURE UGLY - I bought Bitdefender 3PCs/2Years from Amazon, originally to get rid of products like it. And Bitdefender, in my experience, is among the very worst.  Bitdefender first threatened to turn off their product after one year, on a two year 3 PC license agreement. They did this through one of the most irritating string of banner pop-up ads I have yet encountered.  Then, a year later, as the two-year license was really about to expire, they renewed the nettlesome pop-ups. These ads, in addition to being frequent and large, had a clever twist, when the big red kill X was selected, the ads merely sent more pop-ups.  Then after multiple attempts to uninstall Bitdefender using Windows 8 &#34;Programs and Features&#34; uninstall, it wouldn't uninstall.  When remove is selected within Bitdefender, instead of removing the program, it sends more ads. Your computer, your choice.   Getting through to Bitdefender, through their website or other search means, is impossible. Bitdefender, if you are listening, or for that matter, if you even care, any comments?  Please send them to albackus@gmail.com. Today is July 4, 2015. I’ll be updating this report with when and if Bitdefender responds. UPDATE Today is July 17, 2015.  No word yet.	2015-07-04

My purchase of Movie Studio was made after downloading the trial and seeing my imported video divided into sections which was my purpose. This encouraged me to then buy the software. What I hoped to accomplish was to divide my 2 hour captured VHS video into defined sections for easier viewing. Indeed there were sections, but when I tried to insert an &#34;empty space&#34; or an &#34;envelope&#34; sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. Once the empty space was inserted, the length was too long so I tried to make an adjustment...so difficult and it never did work!!! Trying to undo and start again was a horrible experience! I literally had to close the program and then once reopend, I got error after error message until finally it did work. Then I had to start all over again. After this failed attempt, I tried to just create a nice transition effect which also was very difficult to do and finally I just gave up on that. Since I had paid good money for the program, I tried simply making a nice title. Yes, I did that easily, but when I tried to change the background to one of their custom colors - well that didn't work either. Now I am left with yet one more useless and expensive program on my computer. Unless you simply want to combine already created small video clips into a larger video, I would stay away from Movie Studio 13!	2015-07-04

After using Quicken since it went on the market for Windows and upgrading from time to time now finally to Quicken 2015 for MAC following Quicken Essentials I am disappointed. Quicken 2015 looks and acts too different....it is hard to start using especially to reconcile accounts out of the box compared to earlier versions; is not as easy to navigate on the screen and does not display what I want to be looking at on the default displays; and seems very unfamiliar at least initially. I am glad I did not delete the previous version after converting. I have been running it in parallel with Quicken Essentials for two months after converting the Essentials file, and I'm I still not comfortable with it.  I have to admit that the file conversion was easy; but, using the new program for simple, familiar things is NOT. I do not use the program to it's max and I'm certainly not a power user. Primarily I use it for record-keeping and maintaining account balances (for accounts paid by different methods) that's reliable and portable and easy to use. Most previous Quicken versions in Windows and Mac were comparatively easy use from the outset but each new update got  progressively more difficult. I hate that trend. What I like about Mac &#34;Apple&#34; stuff is that they don't stick you with profoundly different feeling and functioning software update. There are other MAC financial programs out there that do the basics. Sorry I didn't check it out before purchasing Quicken 2015; but, you should. If I had the opportunity to do it over I'd stay with Quicken Essentials while checking out other options. IMHO the upgrade is not much of an upgrade.	2015-07-03

I used the 60-day eval and eventually bought the product. I tried Norton this year because the TrendMicro product I previously used was a  resource hog. I gave this four stars because I did have one installation fail; however, all other installations have run without a hitch. Be aware that the final step of the installation may appear to hang as it takes some time without showing an update - just let it run, it will finish. I bought the version of this product that covers 10 devices and I have to admit the distribution of the license to other family members is much easier than the TrendMicro product. Also, Norton is much less invasive on my PC's resources and runs much faster. Time will tell if it is as good at protecting my PC as TrendMicro but so far I am very pleased.	2015-07-03

I went from Norton 360 to Norton Security. Followed the instructions- went to my Amazon &#34;games and software&#34; library and got my code to use in my Norton Account. I did renew early, so I called Norton and they were able to extend my time to include the days left on my current product Norton 360.<br />Norton Security liveupdate is so fast. I am very impressed. Usually when I boot up the computer I immediately go to liveupdate to make sure I have the latest updates. Well it used to take several tries before Norton 360 would finally complete all updates. But now with Norton Security I update two times at the most. Love it!	2015-07-03

I had used the free version of AVG on one Windows XP computer for several months, because the McAfee was not working right any more.  When the McAfee subscription ran out on our other two computers I placed trial versions of AVG on all 3 computers.  When the trial version was about to run out I purchased the AVG Ultimate 2015 2 year version. I've spent about two days getting everything set up, including various tests, etc.  It would have gone faster if I had removed the AVG trial version first; when removing the trial version it gives you the choice to reinstall the free version and that is what a person should do.  Before beginning to install AVG, make sure you know the name of your network if you have two or more computers on a network on which you'll place AVG.  When getting the code in the email or on the web after purchasing the AVG product, make sure you write it down!  When you get your user name and password on AVG's web site, make sure you write that down also!  When you install the software everything goes rather smoothly if you followed the steps correctly.  I had a problem on one computer with an error in the software, but it asked whether I wanted to repair the software--I said yes and after several minutes everything was working OK. The Tuneup package gives a lot of ways to enhance the performance of the computer; it can take a lot of time to perform even some of the tasks!!	2015-07-03

You can customize items for sorting - I use it for rental properties (their rental property software is lousy in my opinion), but you can use the various information fields for different rental properties and it works very well.  I wish that the predictive text would only predict entries in each account rather than predicting entries from another account - I have about a dozen rental property accounts to manage, and the predictive text often predicts an item appropriate only to a different account when downloading from the bank.  I especially like the new feature of being able to preload reminders for bills, as the insurance bills for the various properties come in at odd times, and keeping track of them has been difficult to do manually.  I don't think this was in the earlier version I had  been using.<br /><br />The reporting function takes some getting used to, as the filters sometimes are confusing, but once you get used to setting up a report, you can reuse the report year after year by simply changing the date range.  This is a nice feature in my view, especially at tax time.  It has a lot of goodies for helping with income tax, but I don't use them - they may be a help to many though.  Not sure.  But the reporting function and the ability to customize the reports is very useful.<br /><br />I also use the software for managing personal finances - all the goodies for budget etc are useless to me, but they don't hamper using the basic functions, which is really a good thing, as many other software companies add features that make the basic functions more difficult to use.  Intuit does not.  If you are left brained, it is great software.  If you are right brained, as my wife is, the predictive text problem is vexing for her.  But I am writing the review, and I like the product.	2015-07-03

It's not perfect, but I've always found it easy to use for me to manage my day to day accounts for my consulting business. My upgrade from QB2012 went smoothly with no issues.<br /><br />I don't see any feature improvements over the 2012 version, although I do find the &#34;Snapshots&#34; view to be quite nice. The much-hyped insights view that I upgraded just to have doesn't work for me because I use multiple currencies.<br /><br />I find the new layout to be awful. The colours are terrible to work with and text difficult to read. And I'm a fairly young person.<br /><br />The only reason I upgraded was to ensure that future upgrades are not affected because of running too old a version. Otherwise, I would skip this version. It seems that Intuit made superficial changes to make the upgrade seem like a big change, which it's not.	2015-07-03

Well this software functions well when it comes to almost all of my screen capture needs. Its very useful for capturing video game footage for sure. Also very good at capturing normal screen view of the computer. This is what kills me though: I told my boss that I could Screen capture a power point presentation and convert it to a video format our TV at work can play through USB. It was the perfect idea, no cables no laptop sitting around. I bragged on my Movavi software and all my video editing capabilities and such. Well I brought the Power Point home, set up Movavi (just like i have hundreds of time before to capture other things), started the presentation and started cooking breakfast. I come back in and Movavi is frozen no response, first time I have ever experienced this. I had time to try it one more time before work so i set it up and watched it the whole time (FUN FUN) clicked end show, and yet again it freezes up no response. So at this point im pretty agrivated so i get online and look around for some ways to convert the file directly. AND GUESS WHAT I FOUND?! Movavi has POWER POINT CONVERSION SOFTWARE. In a moment of desperation i almost purchased that too, but you know what? No thank you. Just to be clear this review is on this particular software download, further more the software is very good besides that fact. I am just disappointed thats why i gave 2 stars instead of 1.  (This problem I outlined occurred a total of 11 times.)	2015-07-03

I've been using iBank 5 for over a year. I had used Quicken for many years, but with my shift to an iMac I purchased iBank. i am using the most recent update. I don't know how iBank compares to other Apple finance programs, but I would give it one star. The program is not difficult but it requires numerous steps to do simple things. As someone commented it is hard to understand how to generate a simple report. The manual is not vey helpful, you spend time trying to find something and then when you find it the description is confusing. You cannot speak to a support person. You engage in online chat, which makes it even more difficult to describe and then resolve problems. My wife has a much cheaper program for Apple - it is not very good, but it is no worse than iBank5 which costs much more. In brief the program is not easy to use, it is hard to solve even basic problems, and the support from the company is lacking. I can't see any good reason to buy this program. Be sure to try out the free version before you buy this app. I'm assuming there still is a free version.	2015-07-03

When I read some negative reviews before I purchased the download I chalked it up to people who had older versions of Quicken and then bought or downloaded the latest version.  In other words, they had something to compare the latest version to.<br /><br />Pros<br />I really like that my bank accounts, retirement accounts, HSA accounts, and brokerage accounts can be synced and downloaded into Quicken.  It is a great site to have all your accounts on one screen.<br /><br />Most of my accounts were set up to sync except a HSA account where I invested the money.<br /><br />When I had an issue I would go to the Quicken forum, ask the question and usually get a correct resolution.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Some brokerage accounts like Vanguard do not download correct data.  Sometimes cost basis ends up in share amount etc.<br /><br />When you start on Quicken unless you have one of two accounts you spend days cleaning up all the incorrect information that was downloaded from your accounts into Quicken.<br /><br />After using it for 3 months, there is garbage downloaded that is just strange.  Example, I could not reconcile a bank account and Quicken mysteriously downloaded 2 deposits that I never deposited.  Had to delete these in order to balance.<br /><br />Also, my HSA account transactions mysteriously were added into a Savings account even though the accounts were not tied together.<br /><br />I am constantly correcting stock prices, share quantities and cash balance accounts.<br /><br />It seems like the time spent correcting and balancing my accounts has become a full time job.	2015-07-03

I was afraid to purchase this product because of the mixed reviews but I needed something to help organize my bills so I gave it a try. I don't do anything fancy and this is my first time using software for finances and I have to say, I'm pleased.<br /><br />The program is easy to navigate and accurate so far. I did download the app for mobile and so far, my accounts have been in sync. Overall, I think it was a sound investment for beginners like myself who want to update from using old school handwritten means for budgeting.<br /><br />I'll have to work with the Program more to see if I run into some of the issues that I've read about but I'm optimistically looking forward to no particularly bothersome glitches.	2015-07-03

I finally wrote a snail mail letter to the CEO, Brad Smith. Someone from his office contacted me. At first it seemed like it was an effort to really address the issues. Instead it has been a way to rapidly contact abysmal technical support. All contacts with technical support have been in India. I sense they've outsourced the entire Quicken product line to India.

I first began using Quicken many years ago and found it simple and easy to use.  However, as the years went by and I was updating to later versions and / or / upgrading to more comprehensive versions I ran into two problems.  One of these problems was that Quicken would not allow me to use records created on a less comprehensive version on a more comprehensive and later version and the number of bugs that I kept finding increased exponentially.  Not being able to scroll down sufficiently to see the totals is a massive problem and clearly demonstrates that whoever designed/programmed and or tested it, has no idea that being able to see the totals is very important.  I suspect that the design, programming and testing were done in India, Philipines or South America in order to save money at the expense of providing a quality product.  I have reverted to a 12 year old desktop because it has a very old but far more reliable version of Quicken. When that PC craps out, I will revert to using a spreadsheet.  I do not need the hassle that using Quicken involves.	2015-07-02

I have used Quicken religiously since 2001. The latest upgrade, 2015, is just horrible. If you are used to Alt-Tab task switching to flip back and forth from Quicken to a web-browser and back - you can forget it - it does not work. As a former software developer, I can't even image HOW you make it stop working - it is a feature of Windows! (Alt-Tab still works for the rest of the applications, but you can never return to Quicken with this keyboard shortcut).<br /><br />Portfolio X-Ray is just a re-branded version of Morning star website - nothing new here. None of the marketing material explained that.<br /><br />On top of that the program is significantly slower.	2015-07-02

However, by early 2014, I'd noticed that increasingly often when I'd get performance issues, it would be MSE doing some sort of scan, and after the Windows XP retirement date, Security Essentials would stop working on my XP box whenever I tried to update it via Windows Update.  That convinced me to try the Kaspersky trial, and when it ended about 8 months ago, buy it via Amazon, where at the time the price was a very reasonable fifteen bucks.<br /><br />And it's been good.  I haven't had any performance problems with it, which makes it worth the price over MSE.  And, although it hasn't found any viruses - I typically only get one every 3-4 years - it has warned me of suspicious sites while browsing a couple times.  So all in all, I'd recommend it.  It's only because I don't put it to a strenuous test that I rate it 4 instead of 5 - I've yet to see it perform any miracles.<br /><br />The remaining likely question is, why go with a paid solution instead of a free one if the free ones are sufficient for catching the viruses you get?  I'd gone with free for years for this very reason.  Lower performance impact certainly is a factor.  But Kaspersky also does some pretty good security research and investigation (such as what's described at http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/how-omnipotent-hackers-tied-to-the-nsa-hid-for-14-years-and-were-found-at-last/).  For a pretty reasonable annual rate, I don't mind supporting them in that endeavour, and also getting a low-performance-impact, high-accuracy antivirus product in the process.	2015-07-01

They've all caused problems when I've let them do everything they want to do, and it takes way too much time to pick and choose from hundreds of registry errors, unneeded files, etc. One of those products rendered my system unbootable, which was a pain to fix, and one of them actually had a class action suit filed against it because some of its functions didn't do anything. Recently, I offered to help with a friend's computer that was running very slowly and freezing up. I only had it for a couple of days and didn't have time to fix everything by hand. So I installed and ran the trial version of Advanced SystemCare. It improved performance a lot and didn't screw anything up. As far as I know, the system hasn't had a single freezeup or blue screen since I gave it back. I now have activated versions running on my own computers. It takes a substantial leap of faith to let one of these things loose on a system on which you depend. So far, this one does what it's supposed to and hasn't caused a single problem. It's quite obvious to me which functions are included in the package (a lot) and which are optional upgrades. The &#34;Action Center&#34; tab offers huge discounts on the &#34;pro&#34; versions of the anti-malware, driver updater, and defragger. So far, I haven't needed them but the prices are so low ($3.99 to $5.99) it seems foolish not to take advantage of them. I've read the reviews from people who have had problems with the product and my guess is that their systems were massively screwed up to begin with. You can do a lot of damage with an admin account if you have no idea what you're doing and there are no system maintenance products that perform miracles.	2015-07-01

I bought Omnipage 18 as an update from my very old 4.0 edition. Nice improvement to the product on the whole and at a good price.<br />The reviews that have mentioned script errors etc. are correct in that there is a problem with the version that downloads from Amazon. I had a bit of difficulty locating the right place at the Nuance support site for asking for help with the problem, but once I found it and submitted my issue, I received a link to download the fixed version fairly quickly. (A day or two if memory serves.) The fixed version was provided as a limited-time FTP download, and for whatever reason the FTP link they sent me did not work as intended (I guess) in Windows. Fortunately, I'm familiar with FTP have a couple of FTP clients to choose from. Logged on that way and downloaded without difficulty.<br />So I guess the word of caution is, in exchange for the good price deal, you will have a few hassles.  Nuance should simply make the file available in public permanent link. You still have to key your code/serial/whatevertheycallit into the new version of the file, so I really can't see why they do this one support ticket at a time, but that's how it is.<br />As for Nuance support in general, I have only needed it once before in years of using Omnipage... and I don't expect to need it again for a long time, so it's not much of a factor.	2015-07-01

My current checkbook register goes back this far.  I have finally decided to QUIT the Quicken program.

Even when I check the Don't remind me again checkbox, it continues to shine this irritating splash screen over and over.<br />2) I am sick and tired of having continual problems with corruption of the on-line connectivity.  It has happened multiple times on different PCs.  Quicken's solution is for me to un-install, download a deep cleanup removal tool and run that, re-install.<br />3) The on-line connectivity is so trouble-prone it only works about 50% of the time.  This feature is one of the strongest reasons I hung on as long as I have.  Without the connectivity, it's worthless for my needs.<br />I will do without and figure another way to plan my expenses. About the only critical, can't live without feature is the ability to assign categories to bills I pay so I can easily get my tax deductions.  BUT, there are plenty of other ways to get this.  My bank probably has it for free.<br /><br />It is a shame Intuit has so dominated the accounting market, others I know use QuickBooks and they are just as frustrated.<br /><br />Cynthia Burns - Priceless!

I totally agree with the disappointing, dissatisfied, complete  junk comments.  It should be taken off the market.  If I tried to list all the things wrong, I wouldn't have room.  Its a total waste of money and time.  Since I bought the download,I am stuck with it.  I went back to Printmaster 12 with multiple disks.  If this was an improvement, it was not meant for the user.	2015-07-01

Switched to Mac and would love to have QB on Mac but after using it for a week, it's just not going to work out. Three words: NO MANUAL PAYROLL. As a tiny business with only 2 employees, manual payroll is the only way to go.  There is a way to finagle creating a payroll check as I did (http://www.qblittlesquare.com/2011/02/payroll-i-want-to-do-it-myself/), but you'll find that the absence of payroll/employee reports and the employee center render the product too much of a hassle. I'd make do without one or the other, but not both!<br /><br />I'd like to continue to support QB but not a payroll-less Mac version. So here's hoping that QB rectifies this in some way, or at least will meet us half way (i.e. allow manual payroll OR offer a small business friendly payroll price OR at least allow employee reports).<br /><br />Aside note about QBO: the new 'Self Employed' online option is a step in the right direction but also does not offer manual payroll OR an online payroll option; combine those two and you'd have a lot of new customers!	2015-07-01

I recently bought proDAD's video speed modifying software, &#34;ReSpeedr&#34;, to try slow-motion with video. I knew from samples I had seen that there were likely to be picture artifacts with this software (and also with a more expensive alternative, &#34;Twixtor&#34;), but it appeared that with care, and with some subjects, results could be at least adequate. But, my first attempts with speed changes of 1/2X, 1/4X, 1/10X, 2X, 4X, and 10X with a difficult video clip were poor, and they indicated that the best results were likely to be with subjects that moved against plain (or at least out of focus) surrounding areas, did not move rapidly through the frame, and did not intersect the frame edges. This unfortunately precluded the use of some subject material that I was looking forward to rendering in slow-motion. I then tried using Sony Vegas to render 60p footage as 30p, slowing it (with the &#34;Velocity&#34; control) to half-speed. This worked fairly well, but I was looking for greater speed changes. On a whim, I tried placing the Vegas 50%-slowed video clip (which had a considerable amount of fine detail in it, and which also had things passing in front of and behind other things) on the ReSpeedr timeline. I set the speed control in ReSpeedr for 1/4 speed for a total speed-change factor of 8 between the two programs. I did not expect much - but I was quite surprised by the final outcome (shown on YouTube). In ReSpeedr I had set the speed to &#34;25%&#34;, the &#34;Sub-Frame Mode&#34; to &#34;Optical-Flow&#34;, with &#34;Stabilize&#34; selected, with &#34;Rolling-Shutter Compensation&#34; deselected, and with &#34;Use of Original Frame Rate&#34; (29.970fps) selected, and hit &#34;Start&#34;. The resulting clip showed slight anomalies at the extreme frame edges and (in a surprisingly minor way) with things passing near other things, but overall the results were very good. I then put the clip back into Vegas and stabilized it again there (at &#34;10%&#34; which further smoothed the motion and it also trimmed off the extreme picture edges, &#34;cleaning&#34; those of artifacts - with a result that retains a considerable level of fine detail in the video (although this is somewhat spoiled by the further compression and transcoding necessary for practical streaming on YouTube). Some &#34;curious&#34; artifacting still remains - but at the level at which it exists here, I do not find it objectionable. The original was shot with a Panasonic G5 (several Panasonic MFT cameras produce very sharp video...), with a Rokinon 7.5mm &#34;fisheye&#34; lens, hand-held (without the aid of braces or handles). I later tried shooting a test using 4K video (shot with a Panasonic GH4 at 30fps) and this also worked well when stabilized, slightly cropped, and then reduced to 1080-30p in Vegas (this is also on YouTube – search my name there to find these samples). Overall, I’m pleased with what I can achieve using ReSpeedr in combination with other programs – although processing time when using the highest quality settings can be rather lengthy, even with the use of a very fast computer. Also, this program is very easy and intuitive to use, a BIG “plus” for me...!;-) I recommend it, especially given its moderate price and (potentially...) very good results.<br />--DR	2015-06-30

All or nothing on restores.	I've dropped this from 2 star to 1 star.  I was so glad when Amazon blitzed everyone on price, and then they made their service effectively unusable by not having a sync option.  Google, M$, Dropbox all have a sync folder option.  Apparently, Amazon used to have one but got rid of that feature.  Amazon is dominating cloud services in the business world, but they rely on 3rd party solutions to perform things like security, monitoring, etc.  I trust Amazon more than I trust anyone else (especially Google), but not having a sync or command line option means that I can't figure out a way to automate my cloud backup (using WinZip Pro with encryption).  Why would I use one of the most advanced features the world has seen (cloud computing) and then use a service that requires a manual process for mission essential functionality.  &#60;Revision&#62; It doesn't always tell you which file failed.  Backups (e.g. cloud storage) needs to be reliable.  Either they're done or you missed something that your wife is gonna be annoyed about.  I just told it to upload a directory that had some files in it that I had copied earlier and many new files.  It asked what to do when it saw a duplicate file and I said don't reupload.  I received the message at the end (but as soon as I did something it went away) &#34;203 files copied, 5 files skipped, 1 file failed to upload&#34;.  Copied files are great, skipped files are good since that implies that they were there already, 1 file failed to upload and they didn't tell me what file.  There are no logs to look at.  I'm having to do a directory list and compare side by side.  Revision 2 - If you have many or large files or multiple drives of files (since it's UNLIMITED!) you're screwed.  It lets you download 5gb or 1,000 files via web interface, or you can download everything via the desktop app.  There is no select file with the desktop app, it is all your files.  I have 3.3 tb of files (from several drives) and my largest drive is 2.7tb.  Myfiles are winzip files which have been parsed (2gb each) and I wanted to download one set to ensure that they can be restored.  I cannot select a set of files to download, and I don't have room to download all files to one drive.  I love Amazon for ordering stuff, but they really don't have their act together in technology.  The Kindle Fire has an obnoxious overlay to the Android interface and they don't have MicroSD (so they can charge for any capacity instead of supporting expandability).  I am an IT professional (which is why I want a total backup), but this is the worse product I've seen released in the past 8 years.  If it was any company that relied on this product for income they'd have gone under.  They tried to leverage their commercial/federal cloud market share into the consumer market but the consumer market relies on finished products instead of self-service development.	2015-06-30

The largest cloud provider in the world, and we can't get to an automated sync.  A cloud backup solution requires a manual upload.  Maybe they'll bring back sneakernet next.  Meanwhile, GoodSync!

I decided to purchase Lightroom to replace the functionality of iPhoto when it's Apple replacement, Photos ,proved to be lacking many of the features of iPhoto.  Lightroom appears to be a very capable and full featured program, however, be prepared for a significant learning curve, especailly if you were primarily using iPhoto / Aperture. It is quite a bit more complex.  Lightroom has robust import capabilities for your iPhoto / Aperture Libraries that will import EVERYTHING - like the TRASH in iPhoto / Aperture that you forgot to empty, as well as photos from your PhotoStreams. (Hindsight indicates that it would be best to clean iPhoto / Aperture libraries prior to Lightroom import.) If you are looking to step up from a basic photo handling program, to one with more robust capabilities, Lightroom is the way to go.	2015-06-30

Like many others I'm super-frustrated with TurboTax 2014 DELUXE.  Changes have been made to the DELUXE version this year such that it is incapable of completing a simple return for a college student earning less than $10,000 per year.  After appealing to Intuit's customer service without remedy my trust in the company has been broken.<br /><br />My daughter received a small scholarship from a trust, resulting in a 1041 K-1.  This has been a regular occurrence for my children for many years, and in all prior years this was easily handled by the DELUXE edition.  This year (2014 returns), reductions in functionality have been made to the program such that the PREMIER edition is required to complete this tiny aspect of her return (literally $219 of income).  These changes were made, in my opinion, without adequate notice of the changes - a &#34;bait and switch.&#34;  All of this was discovered, of course, during a last-minute rush to complete the return, requiring an upgrade to the PREMIER edition from within the program at the retail price directly from Intuit.<br /><br />Intuit apparently did offer a partial rebate but that window expired before I found out about this problem.  I appealed to Intuit customer service.  The lady was agreeable but ultimately unable to offer any remedy.  I hope it was worth the $30 upgrade to the PREMIER version that I was compelled to pay at the last minute, because I intend to do everything I can to make sure that was the last dollar Intuit ever receives from me.<br /><br />By the way, I'm a degreed accountant from a prestigious school, and have worked for many years in &#34;Big 4&#34; public accounting, and corporate controller positions.	2015-06-30

And the manufacturer, Intuit, knows that and grossly overcharges for it. Their product development costs have to be minimal, as the basic product itself hasn’t changed substantially in years. In today’s world of free and nearly free apps for our phones and tablets, it is hard to justify why Quicken costs as much as it does.<br /><br />If you have used Quicken previously there is precious little reason to consider an “upgrade” more often than every 10 years or so. And then you are better off just buying a new full-retail version from Amazon or any other reseller rather than get a product update from Quicken at a cost that’s actually more than buying the full version anywhere else.<br /><br />When buying Quicken you are faced with an array of different versions. Hint: most of the functionality is the same in all of the versions, with only a few relatively minor tweaks to customize them for different user preferences. It is critically important for you to realize that the “Starter” version is for first time users only, you CANNOT import data from any other Quicken version … you can only start a new file from scratch.<br /><br />I downloaded Quicken 2015 kicking and screaming because I had to, not because I wanted to. I was perfectly happy with the much cursed and maligned 2013 version (that finally was patched to the point of being okay) and after doing a clean restore of my computer in anticipation of WIN10 coming I found out that my 2013 disk was misplaced – likely accidentally included in a batch of stuff I had shredded recently. Knowing that Quicken comes out with their “new” version every year in September I hated the thought of paying full retail price in July for “last year’s” version (2015). I wouldn’t have bought any new version so soon if I still had 2013 available to use. And, Quicken being Quicken, I wasn’t able to use my backup files with the older 2011 version I still had.<br /><br />After installing 2015 Deluxe I can safely say I could not find one tangible change from the 2013 version I had been using. This is not just an unsubstantiated comment, I am very much a Quicken expert. I bought Version 1 on a 5.25” floppy disk directly from the original developer when it was first invented and I have used it non-stop since then.<br /><br />My install of 2015 should have gone smoothly, but no. While they haven’t done much to change it, they have done some subtle tweaks that ranged for me from minor irritations to some loud grrrr moments. The minor irritation came from version 2015 making the process of linking to my bank account to download transactions more complicated. I have no idea why but what used to be a one-step process took me almost 2 hours to set up and get working because it kept telling me my password was wrong (the same password it just accepted seconds earlier). It said it would send me an email to reset the password but after trying several times they never sent the email. Then they said that my bank locked me out after repeated attempts (my bank told me that was impossible, that the problem was with Quicken). I then bypassed Quicken's super-secure bullet-proof password safety features at the push of one button (something that a 98 year-old grandma hacker could do in 3 seconds and steal all of my data) and bingo I was in.<br /><br />The major frustration though came from some (unknown) reason that Quicken didn’t just download my bank’s transactions from the date I last used it, but instead felt it had to go back and re-download things that had already cleared and “rename” them. In doing so it left me with numerous duplicate entries and a lot of items lumped together with the same dates, as in several direct deposits from one source all dated the same day. What that did is left a whole series of red entries that shows as overdrafts. They never were, of course, but it made a mess of my meticulously maintained checkbook register that I had to go back over a 6-month period and re-enter manually item-by-item using my bank’s statements. It left a taste of what so many people have accused Quicken programmers of … living in dark cubicles, never using the product themselves in real life and having no clue the effects their little tweaks were having.<br /><br />I can’t downrate Quicken for me “losing” my 2013 version and having to buy a new one, or the fact that when 2016 comes out I won’t get a discount after only getting a couple of months use out of 2015. But I can downrate it because I didn’t get anything “better” than I already had, and the fact that the few minor tweaks they did do make my life harder, not easier.er a 6-month period and re-enter manually item-by-item using my bank’s statements.

Seemed fine till 2 days ago.<br />While chatting online with an Amazon Customer Service Rep. of all things it seems to have gotten hacked.<br />Every day after starting the PC it seems to be OK, but after 1st update of the day it will not open, The companion program reports that Mbam driver is present but turned off now. It re-enables the driver and does a scan. Mbam works for the rest of the day usually, but the process wastes 15 - 45 minutes and is a malicious wear of the hard drive too doing extra scans.<br />This is hardly the 1st time I have had an A/V itself hacked, at least it has companion software to help. With others you have to hope you can even get back online (probably unsafely) to root out the problem or re-install the A/V.<br /><br />If nothing else it is a solid reminder that nothing really protects you against determined attackers when online, all the A/V companies even admit it now.	2015-06-29

Since then my machine gets a blue screen and then shuts down every few minutes after start up.  I spent 4 hours with McAfee tech support and they took it off the machine and re-installed it.  This did not fix the issue.  I had to call back.  After another hour on the phone, the tech confirms that McAfee is causing the problem but a Level 2 tech can't help me today and maybe 4 days from now will call me to fix this. The level 2 tech never calls. If I look online, this is a very old problem posted with McAfee over several years.  his has been a nightmare and immense time waster. A serious virus had us remove McAfee from our company years ago. I had personally stopped using it back in 2009 and now I'm an idiot to think they have fixed anything correctly in 2015.  Use Kaspersky instead. I have never had a problem with them.	2015-06-29

If your computer dies or the data is corrupted before you deactivate the software, too bad, you just lost a license. See their official policy here: http://support.rosettastone.com/en/language-learning/articles/How-to-deactivate-my-Rosetta-Stone-program (IMHO this is completely unacceptable for such an expensive app. They need to do server side tracking of active installations.) - Their support takes forever to respond. Last time I e-mailed them about an installation problem it took 3 days to get a human response. - At some point my progress was lost, even though my progress was allegedly being sync'd up to TOTALe.  All of the words I was having trouble with, and all the other stats they use for tailoring the reviews and stuff, are gone and I essentially need to re-train the app to my skill level, which is nearly starting over. - Version 5.0 has a minimum height of 790 pixels (in OS X), which is taller than the screen resolution of the 11&#34; Macbook air. Because of this the bottom of the window is cut off.

I'm using the product for several years and it works as expected. I have an issue with Kaspersky customer support, though.<br />I've ordered this product and because it's only an activation code I wanted to make sure it works. So I replaced my existing license with the new one for maybe 20 seconds to see that it's accepted and then switched back to my old license that is still valid (to the end of June).<br />A week later, 3 days before the old license expiration date I decided to switch to the new license only to see that Kaspersky started counting from the day I've tested it, thus leaving 352 days out of the 365. It's not a big deal, but it's not right.<br />I had several email exchanges with Kaspersky's technical support and after a debate they gave me a new code saying that this is something they will not ordinarily do. Today, I've used the new code only to find out that it has 359 days. As I mentioned before, several days is not a big deal, but this is wrong. Why they choose to annoy a loyal customer with such nonsense and make me and them loose valuable time is something beyond my understanding. 4 stars to the product,  1 star to their customer support behavior in this case.	2015-06-28

Even my accountant, who has used Quickbooks for years, was perplexed by the set up and views in the MAC.  He really couldn't help me wade my way through it.

Eventually the problem with each of my 3 financial institutions self-corrects only to quick working again - obviously a problem at Quicken or with financial institutions having problems with the upgrade.  Quicken should field a flawless product and not depend on users to identify and attempt work-around solutions for them.  This is my last upgrade.  If I cannot find replacement personal finance software, I will return to pen and ink management of my accounts.  If there is a solution, I welcome hearing it.  In reality, I'm convinced Quicken is broken and I just needed to vent.	2015-06-28

I’ve never extensively used many of the product features like reporting, budgeting, investment tracking, etc.  I primarily use it to download transactions, be reminded of and pay bills, and account reconciliation.<br /><br />When you first load up the Mac version, it’s initially confusing.  You have to install an app on your Windows device that exports your Quicken file into a format that can be imported into Mac Quicken 2015 — online account access doesn’t transition so well; all my accounts had to be redone for that.  It took several tries, as the option for Direct Connect doesn’t automatically appear as a choice so everything wound up as Quicken Connect.  The option to change to Direct is tucked away and took me a while to find.<br /><br />Once set up and syncing, accepting of transactions is a lot different than I was used to.  They’re in the register, with a check-mark which means it cleared.  If they’re newly downloaded, there’s a blue dot to the left that you click and select ‘reviewed’.  Jarring at first, but now I prefer it — more intuitive and faster.  The entire sync process is faster as well.  I do wish there was something in the account list that indicated new transactions for review, then I wouldn’t have to select each account to check.  Seems like a glaring omission.<br /><br />I knew prior to purchasing that there is no bill pay functionality in the Mac version, apparently something to be added later.  I’ve been using Prism bill pay on my iPhone for a while now and actually prefer it — bills are often paid within minutes of the transaction, and always at some point the day you initiate the bill payment.  With Prism, the due dates are based on biller data, and not what you’ve entered into Quicken as the due date.  This makes the lack of bill pay in Quicken less of an issue for me, but I can see how other users may be disappointed.<br /><br />Account reconciliation is a lot more forgiving in Quicken Mac.  Specifically, there are times when I know the online balance should be the same as what I show in the register, but for some mysterious reason they're different.  With Windows Quicken, I would have to create an adjustment for the amount and mark it reconciled.  With the Mac version, I can just adjust the starting balance in the reconciliation screen to bring the difference to zero.  Accountants might not like this method, but I do ;-)<br /><br />Overall, I like the program and think once they add bill pay, it’ll appeal to more people.ther users may be disappointed.

It is pretty much the same so far as Quicken 2013 or maybe I have not explored all the features.  One thing I do not like is that whenever you add a new payee on the payee field it uses the memorized list.  since the new payee is not on the list it will not let you enter it there unless you go to the Memorized payee list (under edit tab) and add it.  I find that it is an extra step that Quicken 2013 you did not have to do.  I do like the Free credit score feature but I wish it was monthly instead of quarterly.  I was paying $8.95 from Experian and $2.99 from my bank per month.  The $2.99 was for credit score from Equalfax.  Sometimes I use Credit Karma, which is Free!  I do not see any difference in the apps either for Androids or Iphone.	2015-06-28

The dumb fellows don't realize that by zooming you lose a big portion of the frame wheras by adjusting aspect ratio and cropping ratios (like in VLC and other players) you can stretch the picture in video to fill the whole screen without missing any portion of the frame.<br />  I hoped that in one year they would be able to add this feature but it seems the staff is technically incapable at Cyberlink.

Second, I opted to receive some of my Federal Return via a gift card through their 'get more refund' option. This has been a nightmare, nearly three months after I submitted my refund, the link they e-mailed me to claim my gift card states they cannot locate me as being a customer and/or having filed a claim. Therefore, I'm missing my money because they can't seem to recognize any of the information I used when I completed my taxes. I double and triple checked the information and cannot understand why they cannot find my information. To make matters worse, they only provide a phone number (no e-mail) for information, that number is an automated nightmare which so far, has not been able to help me.	2015-06-28

In the weeks we're gone we'd like to have the main desktop protected in case thieves visit and they bypass our camera. If you have a desktop there is a problem with this &#34;solution&#34;. Most desktops are hardwired. When I installed it and checked my location it was off by 10-15 miles. A neighbor could steal my desktop and it would show their location in a different county. Might as well be a continent when you live in the mountains. It appears this is best for a laptop with wireless. It notes it triangulates via wireless hotspots. I guess if a clueless thief steals your &#34;wireless laptop&#34; and goes downtown near known hotspots you might catch em. If they do know about this advertised to death old technology and removes 2 screws on the bottom of your laptop and removes the wireless card before they boot up and remove the software you won't.  I bought an internal USB adapter. I will attach it to my motherboard and to a USB wireless dongle and see if that works. But I still don't see that's it's any use outside of a city. Recall the many limitations of wireless in even ideal conditions.	2015-06-27

I'm giving this product a 1 star review because it's absolutely absurd that there is no unsubscribe option to the spam that Norton starts sending you when your subscription expires.  Our company switched from this to BitDefender because we've outgrown Norton Internet Security, and ever since our Norton subscription expired (and leading up to it) they've been sending us warning e-mails telling us our subscription expired or was about to, and to renew.  The e-mails violate the law by not providing any unsubscribe option, logging into our profile there is no unsubscribe option, we've even used the unsubscribe tool that Norton has on a special page of theirs, we've e-mailed their technical support, and been on chat with their technical support, and been assured that we'd be unsubscribed from their spam, and haven't been.  And yes - the messages ARE from Norton.  It's not spoofed.  It references our license info, and message properties originate from Symantec.<br /><br />You can even look up what I'm complaining about on Google and see that this is a fairly widespread issue that people have been complaining about for years!  And they continue to do it.  It'd be nice if the federal government would enforce the law and hit them with some penalties.  I ended up just blocking their domain from e-mailing us anymore, and it's ridiculous that I've had to take this step to stop the spam.<br /><br />So ask yourself: do I want to do business with a company that will spam me when I decide to let my subscription expire?	2015-06-27

I've tried iBank 5.5.3, GnuCash for Mac 2.6.6, Moneydance 2015.5, AceMoney 4.36.1, and now Quicken for Mac 2015.  Each is unsatisfactory in its own way.  This review applies to Quicken for Mac 2015 version 2.5.0, with some comments about comparable programs.  The best thing about Quicken for Mac is that export of Quicken Windows data (via a Windows-based add-on exporter) works reasonably well.  Not all data can be imported into the Quicken for Mac 2015, because it simply doesn't support the same feature set, but I'd rate the process as very good on the average.  The import process is almost as fast as Moneydance, much faster than GnuCash, and much, much faster than iBank (which takes many hours to import the same data that other programs import in minutes).  After import, Quicken for Mac balances are mostly accurate, which can't be said for some other programs.  Speaking of keeping account balances correct: The basic function of a personal finance package is to balance your checkbook and other accounts.  How hard could that be?  Well, much got lost in re-designing Quicken Windows into a Quicken for Mac; and &#34;reconcile to online balance&#34; and &#34;reconcile shares&#34; functionality is gone.  Instead, you get to manually enter starting and ending balance (from printed statements?), then reconcile transactions between those two dates -- only cash, not shares -- and that's even for online accounts downloaded by Quicken for Mac.  Unfortunately, that's not a quick way to balance your checkbook.  Why is a sensible reconciliation feature missing on the Mac version, while the Windows version has it?  It's a mystery, along with many other mysteries.  For example, Quicken for Mac can export transactions as .CSV, but then can't import its own exported .CSV file.  Who comes up with design specifications like that?  Another mystery: A brokerage account has a cash balance but, when asked, Quicken for Mac claims that the&#34;Online Balance&#34; is zero in the &#34;Transactions&#34; view -- yet shows it as &#34;Available Cash&#34; under the &#34;Portfolio&#34; view.  That's a bit schizophrenic.  Others have pointed out that Quicken for Mac falls short in many areas (particularly reporting), when compared to the Windows version.  However, the Windows version (running within a virtual PC on the fastest Mac) became excruciatingly slow over the years.  Every transaction edit results in ~5 seconds of internal updates before anything else can be done -- something is badly engineered in the Windows version.  Quicken for Mac (working on the same data) is quite responsive, perhaps thanks to internal improvements.  These are two very, very different programs, even though they both say &#34;Quicken&#34;.  In summary, Quicken for Mac 2015 is not terrible, but it isn't very good either.  It works in a limited way, but some basics (like support for reconciling cash and shares to online balances) are not there, resulting in much manual labor compared to the Quicken for Windows.  On the positive side, Quicken for Mac is reasonably responsive, while Quicken for Windows became painfully slow (running within a virtual machine on even the fastest Mac).  Intuit needs to improve this program.  The competition isn't much better but others are gradually improving their offerings.  Update: Quicken for Mac (2015 or 2016) does not work with T. Rowe Price retirement accounts, although brokerage accounts should work.  TRP offers no solutions for this.  Also, as of late 2015, importing an .OFX or .QFX file downloaded from a bank which uses this method can fail, if Quicken for Mac decides that the financial institution has not signed up with Intuit. This is beyond bad.  Intuit has no business being in the middle of bank-customer data downloads.  This raises concerns about whether Intuit is aggregating information about Quicken users' financial connections, which creates a huge security vulnerability.  For this reason, I'm downgrading Quicken for Mac to only two stars.	2015-06-27

I never write reviews but for this one I felt compelled to.  First I would like to say I have been using Quicken for Windows for the last 5 years and really thought it was a good product.  This past year I was forced to upgrade my Quicken product since they were no longer offering online transaction download support.  So I decided to try out the MAC version.  Every since the purchase, it has been a nightmare!!!  I followed Quicken's steps to convert my existing history and it totally screwed that up.  Come on now, you offer a converter app that just flat out is unacceptable.  I have spent weeks sorting out thousands and thousands of transactions in order to reconcile.  Just when I think I completed it, the app downloads a subset of the historical transactions from my online accounts again.  Are you kidding me!!!  This is by far the worst software product I have ever purchased but I am an idiot believing that I can somehow salvage this and make it usable.  I would never recommend this product to anyone!!!!!  Please do not even consider this until they actually commit to this product line and not try and rip potential customers off trying to pass this off as a real product.  Anyone who writes a positive review is either an employee of the company or has some type of vested interest.	2015-06-27

Update - since this is the only player in the field, they have a captive audience. Today (several months after first review) NOTHING has changed. Says, we can't connect to your account because your password is wrong. Well, the password works just fine on the bank's website. And, when it generates that error, you have to end task and restart the program.

US	31177587	RSROY3U2MMCQM	B00LVDQPG8	192861724	Moneydance Personal Finance Manager for Windows [Download]	Digital_Software	2	5	6	N	N	Quick and efficient, but ultimately unusable	The Infinite Kind developers must have done something right, because Moneydance imports data quickly and feels responsive in normal use.  The same data in Quicken Deluxe (on Windows) shows a spinning wheel for 5 seconds on every transaction entry; in iBank 5 (on a Mac) the import process takes ~60 times longer than Moneydance.  Those are the reasons that made me buy the program.  However: The main purpose of a personal finance manager is to track your accounts, and that's where Moneydance 2015.5 fails dismally.  It simply cannot track what bank downloads say.  Moneydance's idea of account balance is the initial balance plus transactions; this can easily get out of whack but Moneydance won't even tell you that there is a problem, let alone help you fix it.  You'll need to log into each account separately, note balances reported by your bank or brokerage, then verify that they match Moneydance reported balances (perhaps weekly).  This is not what I expected.  The problem is made worse if you own securities: manual tracking of balance discrepancies and manual fixes are needed for every account/security combination separately.  This is worse than balancing a checkbook based on paper bank statements.  As of 2015, Moneydance isn't capable of helping you track account cash and security balances for your online accounts.  So, I'm going back to my old Quicken for Windows.  It's slow, but at least it performs its prime function reasonably well -- Quicken for Mac 2015 doesn't.  UPDATE: Moneydance will report various account balances if you click on &#34;Balance: ...&#34; at the bottom right of an account screen, e.g. for checking this might be Balance, Cleared Balance, Current Balance, Confirmed Balance, Unconfirmed Balance, and Ledger Total.  From there, you are on your own.	2015-06-26

I had previously used IYogi last year but I had problems reaching them after I had paid the money. I am not a techie at all.

I do know that so far, (a few months) ,PC Matic has worked well and typical download averages are good. I also use the apartment's WiFi and it is not as fast as a homeowners private service. I know that the price was excellent and does what other services charge for about a third of the other services. The reason I did not rate PC Matic 5 stars is because of the relative short time I have been using it. If things are still working great  this time next year I will be glad to give it 5 stars.	2015-06-26

The reason I bought it in the first place was the comments on Amazon:<br /><br />Over the years I have tried several recipe programs, but they always came up short with ease of use and support, in fact I think they went out of business. There was a chance to buy an earlier version of this program for a great price and after reading a LOT of reviews on Amazon, I decided to try one more recipe program and am I glad I did. It was a great program that only seems to keep getting better with free upgrades and then after a year of two they have a full upgrade that does cost more money. I was very happy with version 10, but then a few problems cropped up and I contacted customer service. They not only got back to me with answers, it was done within 24 hours. Very consise and easy to follow. When they offered the free upgrade to using their cloud and syncing to my iPad and iPhone I jumped on it. The computer I use for all on the recipes is at my office so I would need to print any recipes I wanted to cook at home, but I could not get it to work so back to customer service. We tried several ways to get it to work, but to no avail. At this point they said they were aware of some problems and they were working on it, but if it would make me happy they would offer the upgrade to the newest version for a special price. I thought their offer was more than fair and I jumped on it that day. Unfortunely, it did not work either and I contacted customer service again, they replied in a few hours with a few more questions which I answered and in another hour they send a VERY detailed message that again was easy to follow and now it works great. I could not be more pleased with this product and how my problems were quickly solved in a professional manner. If you need/want a recipe program this is it.<br /><br />John	2015-06-26

I really hate the forced updates that you pay for. I wait until the version I have expires before the upgrade. I get it. Nobody works for free so this was not my reason for the 1 star. The 2015 version ruined my 8 year old data file. Some glitch or update changed my simple 3 letter password to something I couldn't recover even with the help of the password recovery tool provided by Intuit. I was able to restore an old backup but I lost a lot of current stuff that I had to re-enter. Now it locks up when trying to set up online access for my accounts. I have deleted everything and started over several times. I have spent many hours reading so many complaints from other users with the same problems. They are currently on revision 8 and none of them have corrected any of the issues I am having. I feel like an investor and a test dummy. Bring back my fully functional Quicken for revision 9!  UPDATE: 7/5/15 - THIS WILL BE MY LAST VERSION OF QUICKEN! The bugs keep coming but I will tell you what really works great... The advertising popup window every time I open the program. No matter how many times I uncheck the remind me later box. This is unacceptable! I paid for a fully functional program with no advertising for other Intuit products.	2015-06-25

I tried OmniPage with no success.  I had heard of this program, so I thought, what the heck.  Well, it did the job where all others failed.  I am very pleased and impressed with the accuracy of the OCR output.  The software is a little confusing at first, mostly because of the terminology ABBYY uses, e.g., &#34;read&#34; versus &#34;OCR.&#34;<br /><br />I dinged the review one star because of the headache of installing it on a Windows 8.1 operating system.  Three failed attempts to install!  Kept getting the same error message:  &#34;Access to file c:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Temp\rollback is denied.&#34;  I even disabled the antivirus during install and tried installing as an administrator.  The problem is with the path to the temp file.  This is apparently a known issue and ABBYY has a workaround in its knowledge base.  The steps are not quite the same for Windows 8.1, but close enough.  See ABBYY Article 320.  Fourth time the software installed.	2015-06-25

All the templates are fixed width.  You can select one for mobile which will be 640 px.  Thus, I guess they are expecting you to use your phone sideways.  I think more than half the people on smart phones do not use them sideways.  I checked out their gallery of sites, and all had viewport settings that were fixed width of 900 to 1160 pixels.  Thus PC monitor size sites, which show the exact same way on mobile devices with the small print that you can barely see.  This software is not the right tool for what I need.  And too bad, I really like the look and ease of the interface, and it has good capabilities, including manual entry of html when you want to.  But responsive is what is happening, and Google just punished a ton of us web site owners who are not responsive.  This software still has some advancing to do.	2015-06-24

I would say avoid at all cost, but, what is the alternative.  The new version suffers from feature bloat slowing it to a crawl -- especially when recomputing account and portfolio values.  Then, there is the online update feature.  On most days, Q2015 fails to perform, requiring two, three and sometimes even four attempts to grab security prices; in contrast, Q0212 never failed to perform flawlessly.  And, finally, Intuit wants your data in the cloud.  But I care not to have my financial life floating about in cyberspace.  There are hazards enough with just having it on a desk-top installation connected to the internet.<br /><br />For those new to personal finance software, my advice is, Explore the limited range of alternatives available.  Maybe there is one out there which will meet your needs.  For those of us, stuck with Quicken, I say, force Intuit to make Q2015 files backwards compatible with earlier versions.  And, yeah, to the suits at Intuit, I will pay an annual fee so I can download quotes and prices daily.  $12.95 per year seems fair.  I know you have bonuses to pay.  I just hope no bonuses were paid for this pig.	2015-06-24

I was forced into an \\"upgrade\\", my silly self didn't back up my Quicken Essentials for Mac on my Macbook Pro before spilling wine across the keyboard (Doh!), and Quicken is no longer allowing download of said program, forcing me into either Quicken for Windows or Quicken for Mac. After discussing, when I upgrade I'm probably going back to Windows (sorry Apple, but your customer service was s***e), so opted for Quicken Deluxe 2015 for Windows. Plus, new mobile app option, yay!    I hate it. No keyboard shortcuts for updating accounts, no ability to enter multiple bill reminders/transactions all at once (I have to mouse click enter on each transaction, really?), no spending cloud making it easy to keep track of my budgets (I entered transactions at the end of each month to be like \\"envelopes\\" to take money out of, I never used the budgeting setup in Quicken Essentials).    And the real kicker... it looks/works/functions exactly as Mint seems to. And Mint is free. And I wouldn't have to steal time on SO's laptop to maintain it. And the Quicken app looks EXACTLY THE SAME as Mint's. For $50, I think I should get something other than Mint. The only thing this program has over Mint is the ability to enter bill reminders at all, but if I have to enter them each individually, I may as well use the free program.    Maybe I'm missing something, but I feel like if I've been using it for well over a week now and I still haven't figured out how to use the keyboard shortcuts, chances are pretty good the fault does not lie with me. I consider myself pretty tech savvy and I should not have to sit through google searches and help topics and tip videos to learn how to work the basic program.	2015-06-24

This is, without question, the worst software upgrade I have ever experienced.  I use Quicken mainly as a checkbook and to help organize information for my taxes, and somehow Intuit managed to screw up even these simple functions.  Want to write a check?  Hit control J.  Isn't that intuitive?  Want to see the check and the itemized splits at the same time?  No longer possible.  The development team's guiding principle in &#34;improving&#34; this program seems to have been to transform any one-step action into a three- or four-step action, ostensibly to avoid cluttering up our little brains.  Unfortunately, even after familiarizing myself with the loony graphical interface that features endless nested features and commands clustered on the bottom of the window, it still takes me double the time to write checks in Quicken 2015 than it did in earlier versions.  Adding to these attractions, Intuit no longer offers telephone support for Quicken for Mac and the online &#34;chat&#34; is worse than useless.  Intuit's phone support for their other products features a whole lot of &#34;I'm sorry you're having this problem&#34; and very little knowledge about how to solve the problem.  Even Inuit's responses to criticism on Amazon's site feature this same smiling inanity.  Stay away!	2015-06-24

This is my second product review, the first one was not approved by Amazon and even though I followed their guideline I have no clue why the review was denied. I guess it was some Amazon censorship issue that I'm not aware off.<br /><br />I purchased Elements on June 21st as a download. I followed all the download instructions but I've been having major issues.<br /><br />The end result means I can't use Elements. Since June 21st I've being trying unsuccessfully to ask for help via the Adobe online customer service. I've spent the best part of 7 hours over the past days trying to make contact with them and his has proven to be unsuccessful. It would be helpful if Adobe actually gave a wait time. Because once you sign on you have no clue when and if a customer service agent will contact you.<br /><br />When you tire of waiting and end your chat and then log back in later you ask the same question again and then wait for a response while looking a blank screen.<br /><br />I am now at the stage of giving up and wanting a refund, which as I've downloaded Elements via Amazon does not seem possible. I've seem to have wasted $80 on a product that I can't use nor obtain help from Adobe customer service to resolve. My review would be zero stars but it's  not possible to do this.<br /><br />Amazon are normally the very best in customer service and they are always my go to purchase provider, but in this case they also do not appear to be able to resolve this for me either. Overall extremely disappointed and the Adobe customer service are out of their &#34;Element&#34;.	2015-06-23

As a techie, I have come to expect great malware blocking from Kaspersky, as well as a good deal of settings for a power user to play around with.  I updated to the 2015 version and really didn't have any surprises. My one suggestion would be to lighten up the interface a bit. It feels a bit more sluggish than Norton and Avira, although it's on par with them for malware blocking and removal. If you are running Windows 7 or 8, there is really no need to pay for the more expensive Internet Security version, since Windows has a decent firewall built in, and a firewall is the primary additional component of Kaspersky Internet Security. (Also, most routers have an even better firewall already, which makes any other firewall redundant).  Overall, there are tons of good security options out there today; this is just one of them.	2015-06-23

I used to work as a tax professional and still work as a computer professional and assist several family members and friends in filing their taxes each year. I have aways used TurboTax deluxe But like many other faithful users, Intuit didn't care about customer loyalty or informing their customers about major changes related to deluxe. Talk about a total cluster on customer relations. I only fill out a tax return for my elderly Mother because she is required to attache it to her county property tax abatement form. She has no taxable income, so she is not required to file the return with IRS, but needs it for the county form. Now with the changes to TurboTax, if I need to put an amount on a schedule E for my Mom, I have to pay an additional $30 and upgrade. I only put the gross amount of rent on the Schedule E because it makes no difference in regards to taxable income, it is too low. So long story short, this was, and is the last year I will use TurboTax. Resides everything I cited above, your security is also lacking. You have become greedy, and your product has gone up in price while you take away functionality without being open, honest, and fair about it.	2015-06-23

My Quicken data file got corrupted, so I'm starting a new one while keeping the old one limping along until the end of this year. I had long-since-reconciled transactions disappearing on me and many annoyances... isn't it yet another example of why a monopoly is usually bad?   Anyway, I got to try some of the &#34;let's get started&#34; features of the program, which I've not used in years and years. I'd like to say something positive, but this software makes me so cranky and irritable.  One major annoyance-- at least for me-- is that the default settings make for a lot of extra work on my part. While I was setting up my new Quicken file, starting from zero, the software would connect with the bank, or the credit card issuer, and it was downloading the last 90 days of transactions and automatically accepting them, and auto-categorizing them (90% wrong). So in other words, after it downloads all this, it presents me with register after register of transactions-- hundreds of them-- all of which need to be reviewed/edited one by one. What could be wrong with having the software ask the user &#34;do you want me to automatically download and categorize everything I can find when I connect to this site?&#34; How hard is that?  You may wonder to yourself, why didn't you just go into the preferences and toggle that &#34;auto-download/auto categorize&#34; feature off? Well, one of the downsides of using the program a certain way for years and years is that you have it set the way you want it, and the last time you dug around in the preferences/options was five or ten years ago. Kind of dumb, yes, but I can say the same to Intuit.  They should have an option that allows one to have the data file validated on a regular schedule. That would save some folks a lot of grief.   ===============================   Upgraded from Quicken Premier 2014. As with many reviewers, I am a long-time user, in my case since 1999.  On the whole, the software is more or less functional at trackingthe stuff most people track: paychecks coming in, have you scheduled that credit card payment, how are we doing with our budget, how much has that ETF investment appreciated, and so forth.  There are day-to-day operations which don't seem to be stable. I typically download transactions once each day, just to keep tabs on what's happening, and this crucial operation is very unstable. I have no idea what the root cause is, but we have a fast, reliable Internet connection (cable modem, 100Mbps down) and every day there is at least one or two downloads that generate errors. Most of these are transient; i.e., attempt the download again, and you often see different errors. I can't recall any past versions of Quicken that were as unstable in this way. I do have a decent number of accounts to download-- more than 20, let's say-- but it's not uncommon for me to do a download and get somewhere from 2-5 transient error messages: &#34;such-and-such an account couldn't download because there was error XYZ.&#34; Repeat the download, and sometimes some errors disappear, and sometimes not. It's so unpredictable.  Other oddball errors have happened: transactions disappear, long after being reconciled, the software can't remember payee accounts that have been used many times, and so on.  In a word, this software never gets polished and never functions as well as one might expect, given the price and the pressure to upgrade frequently. It's so unfortunate that there are no real competitor products.  I upgraded from Q2014 Premier because that software contained one very frustrating bug which prevented one from changing certain transactions: if you made a mistake with any kind of IRA-related transaction-- a download accepted into the wrong account, for example-- you could not delete or change the transaction. It became clear that Intuit was never going to fix that for Q2014 when they announced the new features for Q2015. So I cursed them and plopped down my money for Q2015.  Regarding the mobile app: I installed it on my iPhone and tried using it. I entered all my transactions while on a trip using the mobile app. When I came home and downloaded all of my inputs, Quicken created a duplicate account for one credit card and filled it with duplicate transactions. After cleaning up the mess, I stopped using the mobile app, as it was causing more problems than it solved.  Clearly there is plenty of room for improvement, and Intuit-- superficial replies to negative reviews notwithstanding-- seems to have little interest in substantive improvement.  I would like to see a truly polished, functional product with a reasonable annual subscription fee. I always maintain that one should never attribute malice when stupidity or other explanations will suffice, so I am not attributing malice to Intuit. Rather, their monopoly on this corner of the market has made them lazy and unresponsive to customer needs. That's why the majority of reviews here are 3 stars and below.	2015-06-23

I'm an Adobe CC subscriber, which really should be said up front. I've had it for over a year. (If I'd known if I could get it through Amazon, I would have done that in the first place, and then this would be a verified purchase!) I've used several of the programs (Photoshop, Illustrator, AfterEffects, Premiere) for ten to fifteen years. So when Adobe went to the subscription program... although I wasn't happy, I made the decision to stay with them. They're good programs, which is why I can't in good conscience give them less than three stars. They're all far from perfect, but then, nothing is. And yes, it's true that the $50 a month does cover almost *all* Adobe programs and does include a lot of updates, cloud storage, etc.<br /><br />HOWEVER... there's an elephant-in-the-living room enormous problem with the subscription plan for most of the people who actually use these programs. And it is so blindingly, glaringly, painfully, embarrassingly obvious!!! (Yes, it's bad enough to merit four adjectives in a row!) It's so frustrating and so hard to understand why this huge central problem is almost NEVER brought up or pointed out. The problem I'm talking about hinges on the fact that the overwhelming majority of all users are not professionals making a living with graphic design (or editing, or web pages, or whatever.) And this subscription model is only financially worth it for them. Nobody else. Let's look at the figures that prove this really is a fact.<br /><br />According to Adobe itself, the number of CC subscribers is now at over 4.6 million. http://prodesigntools.com/creative-cloud-one-million-paid-members.html<br />According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 259,500 graphic designers in the world who are actually making a living at their work. http://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm<br />From the same source, there are 49,500 film and video editors in the world, although this includes camera operators. Also, a lot of these are clearly using software their employer owns. There are 141,400 web developers and 68,900 multimedia artists and animators. (same story for them)<br /><br />Now let's get out the calculator...<br />(adding it all up)<br />518,900 living wage jobs.<br /><br />This is not a great way to figure out how many people are making anything like a living wage and using Adobe software that they themselves own and must pay for.  But we have to start somewhere. So let's go with it.<br /><br />4.6 million licenses of Adobe CC sold so far.<br />518,900  jobs that might use Adobe CC.<br /><br />This means that over FOUR MILLION of the licenses sold are used by people who are NOT MAKING MONEY by using this software. The VAST majority of all users are either hobbyists or people working seriously on personal projects that will never pay. I know people who fit into both of these categories who have been using the same releases of Adobe programs for literally *twenty years*. The idea that well over four million people using these licenses actually need constant updates, new versions every two years, every single possible program, etc etc etc., is somewhere between laughable and insane.<br /><br />And THIS is the real reason why there is a serious problem with the subscription model.  If you're really making a living (or anything close to it) by using Adobe CC software and the cloud, then it may work perfectly for your needs. For everyone else... that *four million* everyone else... there are some serious issues. I have decided to go with it anyway because I'm working on many personal projects, and three to six different Adobe programs are needed for each one. I don't like paying $600 a year to rent software, but it's a choice that I have made. My main worry is that Adobe really will decide to suddenly jack up the monthly price, and there's no way to know if they will. It's all still worth it to me, but I can completely see why everyone cannot say the same.<br /><br />And again... this central, key problem of hobbyists not needing all of the features, the problem which is so incredibly obvious once you look at the facts, is virtually never mentioned by anyone. I really wish that more people would start to discuss it.tral, key problem of hobbyists not needing all of the features, the problem which is so incredibly obvious once you look at the facts, is virtually never mentioned by anyone.

It would appear what it does is select the video on the disk with the longest runtime as what it will play when you hit play on its home made menu. The only real issue with this is if the disk has more than 1 copy of the movie, like rated or unrated, or if you enjoy watching the extras stuff like deleted scenes as you can select the different videos on the disk but they only are listed as runtimes so there is no telling what you are selecting.<br />This isnt really an issue for me since i have 2 other devices that can play blu-ray, ps3 ps4, and if i really needed to see extras or choose what version i want to watch id just go to the tv they are hooked up to or bring them to my living room, but it is worth mentioning as the extras are important to some people	2015-06-23

It took 20 minutes to activate when it should have been a one-stop, 5 minute,  effortless call.  In order to activate the key, one must call McAfee CS - who may/may not speak conversational English.  After struggling repeatedly to convey the key, a mixed 25 digit alpha-numeric code, he finally got it right, then told me that he would connect me with someone who would guide me through the operation (!).  When I reached that person - (you guessed it) - I had to repeat the key ID again on the same merry-go-'round.  Totaling about 20 minutes of wasted time and frustration, I  was finally able to download the software and install on my PCs.	2015-06-23

I have used both HRB and TT in the past.  I normally go with HR Block just because it is what I have known, but I recently had to do a return from a few years ago, and their prices were outrageous.  I decided to give this a try.  I first downloaded the free copy to see what I was getting into.  To make sure the user interfaces are ok, questions are complete, etc, before I bought anything.  I am self employed so I have to have the fancier ones with schedule c.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how thorough and easy to use it is.  Someone on another review (maybe even for another year's software) that the graphics look like it was made in the 90s.  I wouldn't say it looks that old, but it's not super fancy.  It is easy to use, and it's really not as ugly as other people make it sound, but it is fairly utilitarian.<br /><br />One thing I liked a lot better than HRblock is that the back button goes back to each question.  In HRB if you hit the back button it takes you back to the beginning of the interview section.  That part of hrb was so frustrating, and this software was much better.<br /><br />I think it works just as well, if not better than the others.  For the record, I really don't like TT.  If you have simple returns, try the free stuff.  If you have to buy the fancier ones, at least download the free to check it out, and then buy the bundle.	2015-06-23

The negative reviews here don't seem to be from long time users; this program always had a rather steep learning curve.  You always had to spend time learning it.  I went from Poser Six (of Curious Labs), to P 9 (of Smith Micro--it changed ownership), and it's like going from driving a ten year old car to a new one, in one swoop.  There are the new Diffuse IBL lights, and subsurface scattering , for example.  It pretty much performs the same, but there are drawbacks...the native figures are less than exemplary, compared with P 6's...they went down a notch there.  I don't care so much, I use DAZ's characters.  You have to hit &#34;save&#34; often if you don't want it to hang.  And even with the quad core computer I have, and 8 gigs of RAM, it doesn't cooperate well if you load your scenes down with figure morphs and a lot of detail. (I believe it can only &#34;see&#34; about 2-3 gigs of RAM.)  I also have Poser Pro 2010 but don't use it much, so I don't know if it's a cut above this. Pluses, it's customizable  and it would seem you can build a huge library of add-ons--figures, morphs, lights, etc..  And yes, If you also own Vue software, you can export figures to the scenery building capability of that program.  (though Vue is even more of a bear to learn.) Get a good book or two and take time to learn it, because with what you CAN do with it, you'll have fun. I just wish they'd come up with better figures than the Curious Labs version, AND hope someday they can simulate collisions a bit better. So all in all, for me anyway, it's better the devil you know than the one you don't and I just can't see spending the outrageous amounts of money they want for other, similar programs.  If you want to go to CGI movie land, this is not the way to go. BTW, artists, if you find paying for models expensive and potentially troublesome, this is one way to go...Poser models don't get tired or slouch, so you can leave them where you put them and draw or paint referring to your computer screen, with traditional media...:)	2015-06-22

Unable install  on my MacBook.  I ordered as a download vs physical disc b/c of a deadline / needed urgently.  I downloaded the file about 7 times with various methods including Amazon Downloader, and direct links w/ Chrome + Safari (1.9GB each time).  In each case, I received 'invalid checksum' upon verification.  I turned off checksum warnings via Disk Utility and then got &#34;We've encountered the following issues -- installer failed to initialize. This could be due to a missing file.&#34;  error.  I researched the issue in great depth on both the adobe forums and w/ general searches.  I tried about everything any tech support service could offer while in good faith I went to Adobe chat.  It  was hosed and the software felt awkward.  Finally I got through to an agent and after providing exhaustive detail he wanted to do a 'remote control' operation where they can view my screen to solve the problem.  That's when I decided to pull the plug and cut my losses; After about 5-10 hours of research/ downloading etc.. I called Amazon (on the phone w/ live nice talking humans!) and in about 3-5 minutes they offered me a special case refund on games/software downloads as a courtesy.  I've been a loyal Adobe and Amazon customer for most of my life.  Amazon did a good job of basically cleaning up Adobe's mess this time.  It's mind-boggling, to me at least, that in 2015 a giant like Adobe can't make a download work properly and easily (I'm certainly not the only one with this check-sum problem.)  Also Adobe's chat help, while well intentioned, felt unresponsive. In the future I can't imagine ever paying up front  for an Adobe download -  maybe a trial and pray it installs or just order the physical disc.  ps.

I purchased this program online from a link on Amazon for Avangate for a very good price. Unfortunately, when I purchased the product the licensing key that makes the fully functional 30-day trial version a year long subscription was not sent until 3 days later. Most normal download purchases with other companies are sent within minutes, most at the same time as the purchase confirmation email, an issue that I've never had with anyone else. I had to call PayPal and Avangate because at first I thought I'd been had, they claimed to have sent the key to one address and then I had it resent to an alternate one. When the licensing key finally arrived it didn't work and I was directed to call Bitdefender's pleasant customer service, some guy name Dan with a thick accent. Bitdefender said that the call to Avangate and PayPal created a &#34;chargeback&#34; forcing them to make the licensing key non-functional and to forward emails from myself, PayPal and Avangate, then the licensing key would be reactivated or a new one issued from Avangate. Once again, about a week after purchase, Avangate sent the same non-working license key, claiming that everything was settled. I received a letter from Bitdefender later asking me to forward emails between myself PayPal and Avangate, even a screenshot of my banking statement as proof of the purchase and proof that the purchase had no ongoing (chargeback) issues, which I sent, not showing account numbers, of course. How much more am I expected to send to prove my purchase?<br /><br />Well, as of this writing I still have no license key for Bitdefender, working or otherwise. It's a good thing that their trial version is fully functional or I'd be without protection for nearly a week. What I've seen of the product looks okay and it seems to work, but I'm not getting comfortable into it until all issues are settled and the purchase complete, which doesn't seem to be in the near future. No matter how good the software is, it's just not worththe trouble just from the initial purchase and the untrusty way they deal with customers. Bitdefender apparently does not communicate or communicate well with their sellers or customers and with that poor communication just over transactions it doesn't speak well for the company for other issues, like technical, should any happen. Bitdefender needs to get their act together and brush up on people skills to get customers to return. This will definitely be my first and last purchase of Bitdefender or any software through Bitdefender, Avangate or anyone else who sells it. Take my word, look into other software and save yourself major headaches.	2015-06-22

It's probably the best screenwriting software out there, not because it's really that good, but because there's just a dearth of resources available. Celtx has many glitches--I've experienced losing my saved files, unable to save to the right file, and unable to open the most recently saved version. It's just a mess. And don't even try writing a script with Word. You might as well try to open a beer bottle with a shotgun.  Final Draft is better than all of them. It is stable. It's user friendly and has a very small learning curve. But from time to time it'll act like a recalcitrant child and only wants to do things its way. For instance, the auto formatting function has its pros and cons. It makes your script look professional, but there are lots of irritating problems. Like you can't add an extra empty line between lines: if you press Enter you bring up the Element box. Also when you finish typing a character name and want to add parentheses, you can't just manually type them in, you have to bring them up from the drop down menu, otherwise Final Draft treats it as dialogue and when you press Enter it defaults to Action. The save PDF function is just broken: if you've already saved a draft and then want to overwrite it, you can't, you have to change the file name or delete the previous file first; even that sometimes doesn't work, for reasons I've never been able to find out. Using it I get the feeling that whoever programmed it is probably not a real programmer, because these things are so easy to fix.  So to sum: good program, works well most of the times, but has some irritating problems.	2015-06-22

The most pressing fault with Quicken that I experience is the unresponsiveness to a known fault by Quicken's customer tech support.  There is a known problem when updating investment prices, Quicken throws in erroneous and worse, inaccurate historical stock splits.  This happens even though current quotes are updated, not historical quotes.  If you go onto the Quicken help site you will find it replete with complaints about this for months, yet none are responded to or even acknowledged by Quicken.  A simple, &#34;we are aware of the problem, are working on a solution and will notify all when the solution is found&#34;, would at the very least, suffice.  Is that too much to ask?	2015-06-22

I read some pretty negative reviews about Quicken, but I didn't like any of the other alternatives.  I downloaded Quicken Premier this morning from Amazon and the download process went very smoothly.  I then installed Quicken Premier which again, went smoothly.  Upon opening the program it asked if I was a new user of did I want to import my Microsoft Money files to Quicken.  I then imported the Money backup file (.mny) and withing 1 minute all of my Money information was in Quicken!  It transferred perfectly as far as I can tell and I'm very relieved.  I used Quicken on and off all day and I couldn't be happier.  It works alot like Money so there is a very small learning curve.  I'm a Happy Camper!!	2015-06-22

I thought that &#34;Face Filter&#34; would be a nice bonus with the ultimate version.  I'm very disappointed with FaceFilter.  First of all it is a separate program, it is NOT integrated with PaintShop Pro.  FaceFilter is also the &#34;standard&#34; version not the &#34;pro&#34; version and thus you'll be frustrated and wanting the more expensive pro version.  The standard version lacks a *lot* of the overall features and basically is *only* for tweaking faces (and they should be more or less straight on angles) and is limited to 1920x1920 resolution (pro version can handle up to 6000x6000 pixel images).<br /><br />PaintShop Pro X7 itself is a very well designed and capable photo editing program.  The only serious flaw I don't like is that often when I switch from &#34;manage&#34; to &#34;Adjust&#34; to &#34;Edit&#34; modes I end up losing my edits because it has switched me back to the original photo rather than the one I was editing in another mode!<br /><br />Context sensitive help is very good.

READ THIS TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON WHETHER TO PURCHASE QUICKEN FOR MAC 2015.	I wanted to convert my Quicken 2014 MS Windows data file to Quicken for Mac 2015.  Intuit/Quicken instructions say I must first &#34;convert&#34; the Quicken 2014 MS Windows data file to a format that Quicken for Mac 2015 can read.  This task is accomplished with a program called Quicken Converter for Mac 2015 that converts the Quicken Windows data file from a x.QDF format to a x.QXF format.  Quicken for Mac 2015 requires the data file be in a x.QXF format in order to import the data file.  I downloaded the Conversion Utility Tool from the Quicken website to my Windows XP computer and installed it.  It is named QuickenConverter.exe, version 24.0.0.363, dated 4/6/2015.  My computer is running Windows XP SP3 32-bit.  My Quicken 2014 MS Windows data file contains over 10 years of data, but my investment data starts in September 1980.  Before I started the conversion I brought all of my data up to date and then &#34;validated&#34; it making any noted corrections.  I then made a copy of the data file that I would &#34;convert&#34;.  I then removed all passwords from the &#34;copy&#34; of the data file. After doing all this I launched the Quicken Mac 2015 Conversion program (QuickenConverter.exe) and selected the Quicken 2014 MS Windows data file that I had made a copy of.  The conversion program runs a short time and then Windows displays this message:  &#34;QuickenConverter has encountered a problem and needs to close. We are sorry for the inconvenience&#34;. So I tried the same process on my laptop which is running MS Windows 8.1 64-bit.  I got the same result.  I googled to see if anyone else was having the same problem.  Yep, it's a known issue and Quicken hasn't fixed it.  I reluctantly dialed the Quicken Contact Us number 888.311.7276 for help expecting a long wait that turned out to be about 15 minutes.  The Quicken representative listened to my problem and concluded that she could not help.  She was referring my case to the Quicken Data Research Team for resolution.  They would send me an email on how I could upload my Quicken Windows data file and they would convert it for me.  I received the email which stated, &#34;We have received your case about converting your data from Quicken for Windows to Quicken for Mac 2015. Your case was escalated because you no longer have a Windows computer available to complete the conversion.  NOTE: If you do have a Windows system available, please visit http://quicken.intuit.com/support/help/GEN86441.html for information about how to convert your data file.&#34;  I never told the Quicken representative that I no longer had a Windows computer!!  I clicked on the link and it is the same link that I used to download the QuickenConverter.exe.  Further down in the Quicken email was another link to facilitate the transfer of my Quicken data file to the Quicken mothership for conversion.  I clicked on https://filefix.intuit.com/global.  The site asked that I enter the case #, my email and a PIN.  All this information was in the Quicken email I had just received. I entered the information as required and the website promptly replied incorrect information.  I clicked on the help and it said to call the Quicken Contact Us number, the number I had called earlier, in order to get a new PIN.  I called and this time the computer said my wait would be 45 minutes.  While waiting for a Quicken representative I started penning this customer review.  About 30 minutes into my wait the phone went dead.  I then decided I was through wasting my time with Quicken and would request my money refunded (60-day money back guarantee).  I had downloaded the Quicken for Mac 2015 from Quicken about 25 days ago, so no problem.  Wrong!! Wrong!! Wrong!!.  Since it was downloaded, Quicken requires me to call them to obtain a refund.  You guessed it-- the same number which I just called and which self terminates after one waits about 30 minutes.  The bottom line.  Download QuickenConverter.exe and try to convert your Quicken data file first.  If you are successful, then proceed to purchase Quicken for Mac 2015.  One last comment.  I tried iBank.  The conversion went very smooth.  iBank requires one to export the the Quicken Windows data file to a x.QIF.  Very easy.  Then import this file to iBank.  Unfortunately, I could not use it because iBank does not support Tag categories.	2015-06-22

The only reason I purchased this software was because I needed it for a class. As someone who regularly tracks their foods and exercises through a Garmin vivofit, myfitnesspal, and mapmyrun, I find this software very outdated and not very user friendly. Majority of what I eat, I make myself and it takes so much longer to creat &#34;custom foods&#34; than the other fitness trackers. Plus it is annoying to reenter things that I have already entered in a different application. I wish that there was a way to connect other fitness apps to this software. I understand that this software makes it easier for professors to look at what we are eating/doing, but as a student it is painful to deal with entering data into this software. Oh! And I almost forgot: the calorie calculation is wrong. It said that I need 2000 calories a day. I've calculated my basal calorie consumption before and with my general activity level, I should be consuming about 1,530 calories a-day plus whatever activities I do during the day. My rant is over now. Unless your professor requires that you use this, don't waste your time nor money on this subpar software.	2015-06-22

I should have paid more attention to the other negative reviews, but I just wanted minimal functionality (budgeting & expense tracking) without all the fancy internet data downloads.  Nope, it won't even do that since it uses input screens that are mostly invisible/unusable.

Keep Hoping for More Competition to Lower Pricing and Increase Innovation.	Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, is quickly moving to the Cloud, which is probably a good decision. Unfortunately, the price of the PC TurboTax Business software remains high regardless of the complexity of your tax situation. Nevertheless, buying the business (corporate) version is cheaper than paying a tax accountant to file for you. As a corporation owner, you have to decide if potential tax savings found by an accountant warrants paying $800 in lieu of tax software. The software program leads you through your tax situation step-by-step, but make sure you have your QuickBooks and spreadsheets ready or you'll spend unwarranted time completing the 1120S for an S-Corp return. Corporate state tax returns are another $50, as you find out later after completing the Federal return. That raises the total price for TurboTax Business to $160-$170 since software discounts on this version are rare online or from Intuit. Unlike other software companies, Intuit doesn't offer a discount for an &#34;upgrade&#34; version each year. Anyone using Intuit's QuickBooks software to prepare for TurboTax should seriously look at the online versions; monthly and yearly pricing for keeping track of income and expenses seems easier, although QuickBooks online, as well as Quicken for Home and Business, continue struggling downloading accurate PayPal transactions. Other online financial service firms, such as Wave Accounting, work much better with PayPal. I continue hoping that competitors will challenge Intuit's dominance of the tax return software market.	2015-06-21

I purchased Outlook 2013 because a software vendor promised that I would be able to sync my Samsung Galaxy 5 if I replaced my old Outlook 2007 version.  The download went smoothly and Outlook 2013 performs as promised, along the lines of the mediocre reviews I had already read.  But the software sync never worked and I no longer need or want Outlook 2013 (in fact, the installation installs an Office 2013 shell which renders my MS Word 2007 incompatible -- but there's an awkward workaround for this).<br />Bottom line, I would like to return this and don't recall being advised that it is non-returnable.  So I'm stuck with useless and nonreturnable software (I went back to Outlook 2007 to avoid the MS Word hassle).  I should have paid $10 more ($105 instead of Amazon's $95) and purchased it from Microsoft directly where I understand that it may have been returned.  Doubt that I'll buy software from Amazon again.	2015-06-21

Use something else or build it on your own.	I rarely feel strongly enough about products to come write a review, but after the umpteenth random crash, I've decided to come in here and join the masses.<br /><br />Simply put, this is a very sub-par piece of software that takes what should be a reasonably straight forward exercise of compiling information and turns it into a perpetually crashing, error prone piece of garbage.<br /><br />I use this software mostly just to automatically collect and store transactions from a variety of investment accounts; I don't require the advanced features of the budgeting or break-downs by category, so I am unable to review these features. Unfortunately, this program is the only game in town that I know of that easily logs into each account and obtains the information, but even this is very hit-or-miss (especially at Vanguard, where I constantly must re-enter dividend information that never makes it into Quicken).<br /><br />I was forced to upgrade to 2015 via Quicken's 'forced obsolescence' business model of perfectly good Quicken 2012, which meant it would no longer obtain market quotes etc for my portfolio. So basically, I'm forced to shell out money every 2 years for a program just to keep functionality alive. Which wouldn't be so bad, if the new program could actually do all of the same things the original did without crashing.<br /><br />This version is simply garbage. It constantly tries to update itself and fails, it constantly freezes, randomly crashes to desktop, and lags out at performing the most mundane of calculations. Really, grouping investments based on investing goal and running an IRR should not cause a fatal error, especially as this software is 20 years old...<br /><br />Its honestly so terrible that I think it has convinced me to finally pull the plug. I think I will just build some spreadsheets that take my electronic statements and aggregate it all.<br /><br />I have no faith that all of my transactions have been successfully transferred from my investment accounts, I don't trust many of the calculations I do see (unless they are the most simplistic of Sell/Buy), and I'm tired of constantly crashing.	2015-06-21

I immediately began my trial but was very disappointed when I saw how hard it was to actually access your files.  The program itself only has two basic functions: downloading your entire cloud drive to your computer, or uploading files to your cloud (it is necessary to use this program to upload files larger than 5GB); you cannot browse through your files (clicking the option in the program will only bring you to the Amazon cloud drive website) or do anything else with it.  While this is still a great storage solution for large files which you will not frequently access, it lacks the ability to pick and choose which file you would like to download from your cloud to your computer if they are larger than 5GB or consist of more than 2,000 files.  If you would like to retrieve a file that is larger than 5GB, you will have to download your entire cloud to your computer!  This can be a major problem if you are low on hard drive space, as this will essentially mean that the program is holding your files hostage until you have sufficient disk space to accommodate your entire cloud, or delete files from your cloud until you do.  In conclusion, if the shortcomings of this program/cloud service do not bother or apply to you, then Amazon cloud drive will serve you well.	2015-06-21

You simply drag the file from a folder or the desktop into the input window of Movavi, click one drop down to select the new format to convert to, and another to tell the software to put the new video, hit &#34;convert&#34; and that's it.  It's fast too! It automatically selects the best method of hardware acceleration, and it typically converts a full length feature film in less than 5 seconds.<br /><br />If it was only a video converter, this software would be excellent and well worth the money. However it does much more. You can trim videos to get rid of unwanted scenes, and convert most video formats to MP3 or M4A audio. This is all included with the Movavi Video Converter for the purchase price without having to buy Movavi's audio or video editors. This video converter really shines when converting FLV flash video to MP4.<br /><br />My first use of the product was to download an FLV (with permission) of my son's HS graduation from the school website (using the shareware Video Downloadhelper add-on for fire fox), and cleanly and instantly converting it with Movavi to MP4 to play on my Kindle, tablet, phone, etc, and then using the video trimming feature to cut it down to the parts where he was actually onstage, for posting to facebook, youtube, etc.<br /><br />My only bad experience so far has been converting a large number of files at once and having the new videos skip and jump in a very irritating way. I didn't mark the software down for this, because I believe it was a function of my small Video RAM, and it never happened again when converting just two or three files at a time.	2015-06-21

I loved it. It was the most effective and the least intrusive of any anti-virus I've used and didn't  take up much space like a lot of other ones do. When they retired Norton 360 this year and changed it to Norton Security I was hoping it wouldn't be changed too much. I was a little bit bummed out by the loss of 360, but I optimistically gave this new version for 2015 a try. I'll be keeping it. I was relieved to find out that like Norton 360, it doesn't slow your computer down, doesn't take up a large amount of space and doesn't intrude on or hinder your work. The firewall doesn't give you a hard time or make you unblock programs you use, and the program runs smoothly in the background and you won't even know it's there. For me that's what an antivirus should do. It's very effective. I haven't ever had a virus or malware on my computer with either version. I like that it covers up to 5 devices for one very reasonable price. I totally recommend this product.	2015-06-20

I bought PD 13 last week and it's horrific. In the view screen, the video freezes up It will play for about 5 seconds and the video will freeze up. I have multiple crashes when editing video. I actually bought a new laptop (Lenovo) 8 gigs to make sure I have enough &#34;juice&#34; to edit videos and per my cpu every time I  edit video it uses up utilization of over 80 percent of processing, which is why I think the reason for the sudden crash. To give you an example I use to use Go pro studio on my old laptop and it didn't perform well. Now with the new laptop with the higher processing, gopro studio works fine. I don't want to use Gopro studio as my main editing software, it has huge limitations but seems to work. PD 13 is the worst $60 I spent in a long time.	2015-06-20

The virus protection which is unique with Super Shield does appear to be bullet proof as advertised. So far, I have not experienced any serious threats during this past year while relying on this product. I have 8 computers on my home network and am sad to say that some of the big name virus protection programs have really let me down in the past, allowing problems to consume way to much of my time.  My observation, however, is that there are some free utilities that seem to do a little better with some of PC Matic's extra features. They are Slimdrivers, CCleaner and Malewarebytes to name a few.  This product almost never finds driver updates, while the free utility Slimdrivers has found dozens, although not all were perfect. Sometimes installing new drivers will open Pandora's box and a user must know how to recover or roll-back the bad installation. So I can understand why each minor upgrade to these many drivers is not automatically jammed into your system. But, I'm still waiting for any major driver updates like those that I have had to fish out from support sites to be found by PC Matic.  There are a lot of statistics presented in a summary which means absolutely very little if you have multiple computers. Nothing is linked in the summary to allow easy access to the health or details of your multiple systems that are networked. Report pages should be accessible from this point. The summary seems to blindly tout this program's performance and to give the user a warm fuzzy feeling.  With that said, I would still recommend this product to my friends on the basis of virus protection alone..	2015-06-20

Just a bit about my experience:<br /><br />When I started with Amazon Cloud, they had an app that let you keep a folder on your computer up to date with your Amazon Cloud storage. Simple and easy. Works on a Mac, works on Windows, even works on things like tablets. That's just like Dropbox, Google and several others. I rumbled along not paying a lot of attention to changes. Now I go to install it on a machine I had to wipe. Surprise !!!. When I go to get the same old app to sync things up, it's no longer available. I can keep using it on the machines that it's still loaded on. The re-formatted machine is out of luck.<br /><br />Is there a gotcha with the &#34;sync&#34; approach? Sure there is. If you have 200 Gb of pictures on your cloud, you *do not* want to sync them all with that old laptop with the 160 Gb disk. It's not going to work... All of the people writing the sync stuff allow you to select what you do and do not want to sync to this or that machine. It takes a bit of thought, but it's not that hard.<br /><br />Any bets on how likely this makes me to sign up for the &#34;Unlimited Everything&#34; plan and use their silly new app to get things on and off their cloud storage? Unless they come up with a sync solution, I would avoid using their service. It's just not as useful as some of the others.<br /><br />Why *would* I use their service? About the only use case I can see is for backups. Do a disk image each hour / day / week / month, zip it up and encrypt it. Feed it up to the unlimited plan with their app. If you have a disaster and need to recover, download it and start from there. May not save you from the ransomware guys. They might hit the backups as well as your main disk. It might work when the whole town and every computer in it goes under water.	2015-06-20

Even then, you're better off finding a guitarist or learning guitar yourself.<br /><br />I was hoping to be able to use some of these samples instead of me having to break out my gear from storage and playing it all myself.

I paid the fee, upfront, to get access and enter all my info, with the intent to file online.  But, I ended up doing a manual return and losing out on the fee I'd paid because the program was too time consuming and frustrating.  First, you can't get a look at the 'big picture,' as you fill out the forms.  You can only see the Taxact pages, with their boxes for entries.  If you want to preview a pdf of the whole form, as you go, you have to pay extra.  Second, it would timeout and log me off, again and again, even though a pop up would appear and let me say that I wanted to stay logged on.  Then, I'd have to go back to the beginning. which was the worst part, because about half the time it would drop my info and give me all blank screens.  The first time that happened, I emailed for support, but I never received a reply.  At the end, you can get a pdf of the completed 1040, but not of any of the schedules - again. that's an extra fee.  I finally got so annoyed and spent so much time that I just deleted my entries and filed without any software.  I would not recommend Taxact!	2015-06-19

I had used Quicken for many years. Compared to MS Money when is was still around, I liked Quicken much better. I went through the &#34;upgrade&#34; three years ago and had no problems. I have tried the &#34;upgrade&#34; (required if you want to continue to transfer data from your bank) twice. Once with the Deluxe 2015 and now with the Starter 2015.<br /><br />I am running Windows 7 ... Quicken DOES NOT WORK! I've installed and uninstalled both versions of Quicken several times and it DOES NOT WORK! When going through the install process the program wants to &#34;update&#34; - it never completes ... get to the Task Manager, says its running, but when you try to stop it, the message then says that has stopped working. So, try the install and bypass the update ... Great, I was able to open Quicken only to get the password page (top screen shot in the photo). There is no password, I never created a password, you cannot recover a password. There is an endless loop (the second screen shot in the photo), Inuit help IS NO HELP! Even if you are lucky enough to talk with someone who can speak English, they are no help. The best advice I got from Intuit help was that they know there is a problem and they are working to fix it. They've been working since the end of April - apparent this is problem that can only be solved by the builders of the Pyramids.<br /><br />Almost forgot this important item - I lost all of my Quicken data and had to uninstall the 2012 version.<br /><br />Once again I will be requesting an immediate refund. Silly me - fool me once, fool me twice ...<br /><br /> *** By the way, this is not a negative against AMAZON. The first time I purchased the Deluxe 2015, I got it directly from Intuit. ***<br /><br />I don't know if other folks running Windows 7 have the same problem. If not, I wold really like to know what you did to make this work.	2015-06-19

They have added new features to this version.  There are tools that allow you to maintain your computer, easily.  This is a good choice for those that are not computer literate.  The system installs and updates easily.  from there it can be pretty much hands off.  It will tell you when something needs to be done.  There is system optimization that will clean up and defrag hard drives.  It can recognize the difference between hard drives and solid state drives (if you are on Window 7 or later) so it handles them appropriately.  Another nice feature is a history screen that lets you know when computer events took place.  i.e. downloads, virus scans, detection of issues, etc.  You can click on an event and see the details of what it recorded.  I have used Norton quite a few years on several computers and have never had a virus issue on any of my computers.  This version does a lot more in total system maintenance and is a good buy.	2015-06-19

And Bitdefender, in my experience, is among the very worst.  Bitdefender first threatened to turn off their product after one year, on a two year 3 PC license agreement. They did this through one of the most irritating string of banner pop-up ads I have yet encountered.  Then, a year later, as the two-year license was really about to expire, they renewed the nettlesome pop-ups. These ads, in addition to being frequent and large, had a clever twist, when the big red kill X was selected, the ads merely sent more pop-ups.  Then after multiple attempts to uninstall Bitdefender using Windows 8 &#34;Programs and Features&#34; uninstall, it wouldn't uninstall.  When remove is selected within Bitdefender, instead of removing the program, it sends more ads. Your computer, your choice.   Getting through to Bitdefender, through their website or other search means, is impossible. Bitdefender, if you are listening, or for that matter, if you even care, any comments?  Please send them to albackus@gmail.com. Today is July 4, 2015. I’ll be updating this report with when and if Bitdefender responds. UPDATE Today is July 17, 2015.  No word yet.

Just a warning to anyone who purchases this software. A payroll activation key is not included with the download version. You will have to call QuickBooks Payroll  Support (866-293-1928) and give them a credit card number for payroll service before they will issue you an activation key.. The payroll service is designed to bill you automatically for each additional employee per month (around $2/ea) and at the end of one year, will renew your payroll subscription to the cost of approximately $411. The customer service representative assured me that she had to have the card number first and that she would cancel the subscription immediately if I didn't want the additional services / renewal but there is no way to activate payroll feature without first giving a credit card number.	2015-06-19

Well I'm writing this with the Dragon software I'm not to make any corrections on this first one want to see what it looks like after reading it and then I'll do a correction underneath it so you can see the difference I've had this for over six months now and I use it not everyday but occasionally.. That makes a difference because of the training that's involved in word accuracy. I found that if you make the sentences shorter or stop in the middle of the sentence it's more accurate. Now my first experience with the download and installation of this program on my desktop Windows 8.1 was a disaster I ended up having to do a full refresh on my computer because of what Dragon did to it. But, I was determined to have Dragon software on my computer so I went ahead and installed it again once I got my computer back to running normal again I know why would I do that again well I figured I could just corrected again if I ever got messed up again but this time but this time it downloaded and installed perfectly fine and my computer is been perfectly fine since the Dragon program seems to work really good for me the accuracy isn't too bad. Would I recommend getting this program? Absolutely not I tried putting it on my laptop after it went on my desktop successfully and it messed that up to I'm going to do another refresh on the laptop this time it seemed to make a big difference with my desktop when I did it then. But I am no way going to put the Dragon software on the laptop. So on my desktop with Windows 8.1 and not a very good system only paid about $350 for the tower but the Dragon software works pretty well on it. There's definitely some lag that occurs I use it sometimes with this chat program called Paltalk of course you have to wear headphones with a mic or else it will start typing what everybody else is saying to. As I said this program gets more more accurate the longer you use it so don't expect it to be accurate right away I use it occasionally and have been for about six months, two months ago it was not this accurate. They say talk naturally and useful sentences but I really have found saying just three or four words at a time it's a lot more accurate. Now I said I'm going to rewrite all this without the mistakes but I'm seeing that there's so few of them I'm just going to keep it like it is and let you judge its accuracy. I guess that's all.<br />6\6\2017: update<br />I don't know how many people have read this review thinking this guy who wrote this must be blind. Because now when I read this most of it of the sense. Just to let you know I have updated my Dragon have been using Dragon professional version 15 and in fact I'm using it right now to dictate this comment I'm also on Windows 10 and that made a big difference to if you don't mind spending about 300 bucks Dragon 15 Is Way Way better right now I'm in about the 4th week of training this version of Dragon and it's been absolutely flawless. It installed with absolutely no problems all I highly recommend this version of Dragon.about six months, two months ago it was not this accurate.

I also loaded on out laptops.<br /><br />I assumed it would be like dropbox or google and sync my files, but it dumps everything into one folder,  It also will not completely upload from one of my computers, and it appears that it is duplicating all of my pics each time I start over.  I have 8 full size copies of some pics on my cloud drive now. I signed up for the unlimited plan trial so space isnt an issue, but the way this is going I will be cancelling unless the ease of use and expected functionality greatly improve. It would also be nice to be able to share multiple pics with one link, but there is a separate link per photo, and the links dont have thumbnails...so after you share something, you can see all of the links to your shared pics and delete them one by one of together, but you have no idea what link corresponds with what photo.  Amazon can surely figure this out!	2015-06-19

I spend twice as much time repeating myself, correcting what the thing has done, and trying (often unsuccessfully) to look things up. You will repeat yourself well.............repeatedly. You will speak so slowly and clearly that it sounds as though you are making fun of someone. You will not want to use this thing with someone in the same room. Or in the same house. Customer service? Sit on hold or get disconnected from &#34;Live Chat&#34;. A person using the &#34;hunt and peck&#34; method of typing would get a paper done before someone using dragon.<br />Yeah, it looked really great on the commercial for the kid who couldn't use pencil and paper like everyone else. That sounded like a learning disability to me from the start but, hey, if grandma wants to buy the kid a $100 software bundle because he lacks the motor skills to use a #2 pencil..............go for it.<br />Adults, teens, kids.........if you can type even moderately quickly............30 wpm even...................just stick with it. This software is ridiculously ineffectual. The tutorial is all of 5 minutes...........but the things brags about how it has an ENDLESS amount of possibilities. This is confirmed if you want to print their actual instruction manual.Some of us like to have something solid on hand that we can flip through, not a screen to scroll down. The manual is very easy to find and print. All TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY SIX PAGES OF IT.<br />I was skeptical as to how precise this software could actually be but figured that there ARE a lot of smart folks in the world designing these things. I should have listened to myself. The repeating yourself and constant leaning forward or adjusting yourself to use the keyboard and mouse make it an awkward and frustrating experience from the start. Frustrating to the point that you don't even WANT to get your work done. You just want to get up......................drop the terribly cheap headset..............and walk away before your $100 software causesyou to smash a $1,400 laptop against the wall.	2015-06-19

Shortly thereafter, the hard drive went out and I had to get a new one. I had to reinstall the OS and all of the drivers. When I went back to the Norton site to reinstall the software, I got the runaround from their pages and links. Basically, they did not recognize the new operating system, even though it was the same motherboard. I was under the impression that since it was the same device, it would just reinstall, but obviously that is not the case. However, while getting shuffled around the Norton pages, I realized that it was an automatic renewal after a year. I disabled that of course, since I do not even now have it. I guess they just wanted me to buy it again, but I am not going to do that.	2015-06-18

I've found this software to be more than adequate for editing my photography, which is a hobby of mine that I've had for a few years now. I'm certain that there are other programs that are &#34;better&#34; in some aspects but PaintShop has been the most advanced program I have invested in thus far. Previously I was using Smart Photo Editor because of it's very low pricing but the overall quality of a finished product was really no good. Even when maximizing the quality of the image based on it's provided scale, it would be less than pristine and I was not settling for that. Even after purchasing this I continue to use PortraitPro 12 for all of my fashion or model based photography. Now, allow me to break down this software for you a little so you can get a better understanding of how it works!<br />There are three main tabs at the top of the opened software page; Manage, Adjust, Edit. Each of which I will highlight and give a pros and cons rundown of.<br />:Manage:<br />This tab allows you to &#34;quickly&#34; search through the folders of your computer in order to select the right photograph or group of photographs for editing.<br />Pros -<br />1.) There are thumbnails that give you a preview in the center of the screen after you open up a particular folder that allows you to quickly preview the photographs in the album.<br />2.) The right side of my set up I have the info widget that gives you a detail rundown of the file properties and the camera data that goes along with it. This is very helpful when considering maximum file size for site uploads before editing.<br />3.) The bottom left of my screen I have a preview widget with helps me to determine which specific shot I am looking at if I took multiple of the same thing.<br />Cons -<br />1.) Really the only con to this tab is the Navigation widget, because it isn't the best organized and it's ultimately easier, in my opinion, to go through the File Explorer on my computer to select the image I want to open.<br/>:Adjust:<br />This tab gives you the basics of photo editing so you can quickly adjust and modify an image to your liking. *I would recommend starting with editing mostly from this tab and familiarizing yourself with it before moving on to the Edit tab so that once you are aware of the particular functions each part has in this one you will be able to better understand the next*<br />Pros-<br />1.) This is definitely a very simple interface and really the only basic essentials you would need to get the job done.<br />2.) The Adjust widget has a breakdown of all your tools like cropping, straightening, there is also the &#34;Smart Photo Fix&#34; that has sliders like Brightness, Saturation, etc. It also contains other sections like White Balance, Digital Noise Removal, etc. Easy to navigate and the changes are quickly analyzed and previewed.<br />3.) The center of the screen has the preview of the image you are working on and it modifies the appearance as you are working on it.<br />4.) The tool bars and organizer widget give you a quick rundown of saving, file options, rotation, a preview of other items in the folder and other helpful devices.<br />Cons -<br />1.) Try to keep in mind that this is the simple part of the editing this software provides, it's all the essentials so you'll feel comfortable with this tab but leaving it is very hard. It puts you in a comfort zone and it's very hard to leave, for some people this could be a serious issue.<br />2.) The worst part about this tab is the &#34;Instant Effects&#34; widget. They are all poor options in my opinion, none of them really give any sort of satisfaction that the work you're doing is going to look good if you use them. Just my opinion, so take that as you may. The only plus side to this widget is that there is a preview of how badly you're screwing up your image with using it, but the preview is small so once you double click with confidence, don't be surprised when you Ctrl+Z.<br />:Edit:<br />This is your in depth editing, just about anything and everything you can imagine can be done on this tab once you have it figured out.<br />Pros-<br />1.) The organizer widget at the bottom of the page and the preview in the center have migrated from the Adjust tab into this one, which gives the user a sense of familiarity once you make the transition over to this tab.<br />2.) The tools thrown around on this page are either labeled or have an image that gives a pretty clear assumption as to what they do.<br />3.) &#34;Learning Center&#34; which THE BEST THING EVER for someone just getting used to using this software. It gives you a breakdown of each tool and widget and you name it. You will need this, you will love this, you are welcome.<br />Cons-<br />I don't feel like listing all this out is the most effective way to give you an understanding of the cons of this tab. They can be taken as pros by some people, but for me I find them negative. The tool bar at the top of the page has a drop down menu that gives you different names of what you might be looking for. It's unnecessary, just use the learning center. The materials widget and the layers widget are unclear to me for exactly what they are trying to do. I feel like gimp has a clearer representation of what you can do using these tools and it's free so you should consider getting it if you'll need layering. Overall the interface of this tab is not the most user friendly and it can be a real pain to use. Once you get the hang of it, this can be a photographer's best friend.<br /><br />Overall opinion?<br />For the price, it's a great investment. It will definitely do everything you need as a hobbyist and even if you become a little more professional with your work, you'll find this to be useful and a great tool to have. I like it, it isn't the easiest to use at first, but give it time and try learning something and it will pay off.	2015-06-18

The previous version of Quicken worked fine (2012), but since the pretty much, forced upgrade to 2015, it's been crashing and hanging quite often.  Once it's running, it's fine.<br />A lot of times, it just hangs on start up, freezes, so I need to force close it.<br />Other times, it has problems doing the One Step Updates.  Issues with it crashing upon the start of the update and sometimes at the end of the update.<br />Each crash, hang, upon restarting the program, everything seems to start working fine again.<br />It seems a little slower than the older version as well, longer to start up, longer to do certain tasks.	2015-06-18

I've been a quicken user for over 20 years.  I don't mind paying for the forced upgrade if the software hadn't been so buggy, unreliable and unstable.  The automatic upgrade became hellish nightmare because data was not converted correctly.  I had to spend days fixing the screwed up data.  The stocks I no longer owned suddenly needed correction, most of the splits needed corrections due to rounding errors, and worst yet, the spinoff could not be corrected if wrong data was provided, and some transactions could never be updated and got stuck in never land, and the list went on and on.  Even the online help could NOT resolve some of the issues.  I guess Intuit still doesn't know what went wrong because the support is next to none.  Back everything up before updating transactions.  You will never know what is going to go wrong next, and unfortunately, something always goes horribly wrong.  I guess this software would probably work better if you start with no data.	2015-06-17

After I got it, I realised it feels exactly the same as iMovie, but isn't put together as perfectly. I had crackling audio and had problems adjusting the transition effects duration. After spending a few hours on it, I called it quits and regretted not trying it before i paid for it. If you're not too fussy, wondershare is ok for people without iMovie. If you have mac, don't waste your money.<br /><br />I solved my text problem. Go to photoshop, remove the background and add any text you desire and save as a transparent PNG. During this time, I also discovered some new features in iMovie.	2015-06-17

Really seems to clean things up and make my PC's run faster.  That being said there are a few annoyances: 1. Every time I start up the program, it tells me I need to reboot my PC to complete changes, of which there have been none. 2. Even though I have paid for the program, it likes to nag me on every possible occasion to pay for another year. 3. It told me I should download a new driver for my video card, which created havoc and nothing worked properly.  While they couldn't have known this would happen, on the other hand they did not provide a rollback feature. Tech support has been completely useless on dealing with these issues.  The offer advice that shows they did not understand the nature of the problem and is of no help whatsoever.  The only exception was the nagging to buy another year, but the required turning off &#34;tips&#34; so who knows what else is not being displayed because of this change.	2015-06-17

I'm a YouTube movie reviewer (Drumdums) and have used various video editing programs such as Wondershare and Corel Videostudio X8.  Wondershare was too basic for my needs, and Corel was just too buggy, so I would constantly have output issues.  Adobe Premiere Elements is exactly what I've wanted in a video editing program.  It does take some time to discover all the possibilities, but the patience definitely pays off.  I've been using the program for a few weeks, and it constantly surprises me.  Here are the features I love so far:  - The editing layout.  I love that the main video bar is at the bottom, and all your pictures/effects are added in bars above.  You can add plenty of layers to your video as well. - The &#34;added effects&#34; button.  Any effects you add to your video are placed within this button for quick access.  Need to quickly tweak your color/lighting settings...it's all right here. - Effects!  There are so many options here...and I haven't made my way through all of them.  My favorites are the &#34;Perspective&#34; feature which lets you add depth to pictures, drop shadows, blurring, etc.  Also the &#34;Keying&#34; allows you to use green screen.  And it's pretty easy to use too. - Tools.  This really comes in handy.  I love the &#34;pan and zoom&#34; feature for my photos.  It really gives any presentation a professional look. - Render on the fly!  Click the render button after you've loaded your initial video.  This will make your playback during editing much smoother.  I love this feature! - Final render/publishing options.  This allows you to output your video in so many file formats...and even directly to Facebook, YouTube, and other social sites...all in 1080p too.  I always get really smooth, consistent output too (I didn't get this with Corel).  Make sure your computer meets the minimum requirement (really well above).  This program is a beast and a weak PC won't be able to cut it.  I bought an Asus ROG (i7 processorwith 16 GB RAM) that is specifically for this purpose.	2015-06-17

This product uses fairly little resources and doesn't slow down the computer at all.<br /><br />HOWEVER, There is a particular practice Symantec has been doing that is questionable at best. When I pay 34 dollars for a product I expect it to work forever, even if I don't renew the license.<br /><br />When my license expires I don't expect to get the latest updates, I don't expect to get the latest security updates. What I find absolutely appalling is when your license expires with NORTON *THE ENTIRE PROGRAM BECOMES DISABLED&#34; that means instead of at least providing outdated protection is provides NO PROTECTION. Clearly Symantec has put profits over security. These guys praise their products as providing the greatest security but yet the minute you aren't paying the renewal fee they disable this program. Further it will constantly prompt you to update your license over and over again. The renewal price is actually more than just paying for another copy off of Amazon.<br /><br />I will NEVER order another NORTON product again as along as they continue this behavior.	2015-06-17

Paying is the easy part, then you link this subscription to your autodesk account, then you have to create a user in your autodesk account to use this subscription (something you don't have to, when using the trial version). Issue? The Manage user part doesn't work. You put in the information, but the user doesn't get created. So you cant use the software, I spend 2 hours reading every forum on autodesk web page, a lot of people with the same issue, one gets thru other never do.

I love paying $9.99 a month for everything I own. Monthly payments are great, till you have so many of them you are out of money. When your money coming in does not match the money going out, well you get the idea. I have bought every version of Lightroom for 2 to 5. Monthly payments even when I do not use it every month.<br /><br />The CC push was the handwriting on the wall, and only new features made it to Lightroom CC, not to the buy the box version. Adobe dropped Photoshop, and soon too Lightroom will be only a CC product. So find something else now. Or once Adobe completely drops boxed editions count that $9.99 a month heads up, maybe $49.99 a month next year ?<br /><br />SURPRISE, not at all, Adobe is only for very large publishing companies, and professional photo studios with 10 or more photographers on staff. Adobe does not want small studios. Adobe has the mindset of Digital Research the owner of the CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers[3]) operating system, they only wanted the high end market. Digital Research turned down IBM when asked to create the new operating system for the upcoming PC. Bill Gates jumped on that deal, so Microsoft is a household name and Digital Research well not so much. The question I have is who will replace Adobe ?	2015-06-17

It does it's job... I took 1 star off for the following reason:<br />The past few years I've used H&R Block Online, essentially this and the online version are almost identical, except the online version is &#34;cloud based&#34; vs. this one saves to your PC. The software went on sale so I bought it (better deal then the online variant for the same service).<br /><br />So I took a star off, because the online version and the software version do NOT talk to each other (I hope they fix this), since I've always done it via the online version it would carry my info over from previous years - this software does the same thing providing you use the software version each year. Since I went from online to software, however I had to re-enter everything from scratch. Seeing how similar both products are I don't understand why H&R block can't download your online filing(s) in to the software version and vice versa it would be a great feature if the software version saved a copy for safe keeping and continuity back to HR block cloud for safe keeping and interoperable if you opt to go back to online next year.	2015-06-17

Each new version of Office seems to me to be the old version with some stuff moved around. They don't innovate, they redecorate. There are, of course, new features that I'm perfectly willing to believe are useful to some people, but not to me. For me, the only effect of the changes is to cause me to come to a halt every fifteen minutes and figure out how to do what I was already doing with the previous version, usually more simply.  For example: the horizontal scroll bar in Excel disappears seemingly by itself. Enter &#34;scroll bar&#34; in the Help window and you get no hits, as though there were no such thing. I never had a problem with this in the previous version.	2015-06-16

I eventually got it running, perhaps correctly, but what a pain.  I went to the Kaspersky site and downloaded what I thought was the right version of AV.  Turns out to be AV2013.  I fail to understand why you can even find it on their site.  Installed, tried to register, failed.  Blah blah blah.  Went back to Kaspersky site, found something labelled as the &#34;current&#34; Windows version, downloaded 160Megs, started it up and it immediately reported that there was a newer version that needed to be downloaded.  OK, spent some more time.  Installed that, started it up, and all the various modules reported that they failed to load.  Registered and was told that it needed to be updated.  Again?  Clicked on whatever it said and stared at a &#34;connecting&#34; screen forever.  Went out to lunch, returned, still &#34;connecting.&#34;  Closed that, rebooted, various modules again failed to load.  I can no longer remember what steps followed, because I has now wasted something like 3 hours in an already over-scheduled day.  Finally, somehow, got it started on a scan.  The time estimator needs some serious attention, because it kept telling me something like 5 minutes, came down to &#60;1 minute, then was back at 7 minutes, etc.  All the time it was 87% done.  Something over an hour later the scan completed, with no errors, no malware, no nothing.  Meanwhile, the machine was completely unusable.  I seem to now be running in some &#34;normal&#34; mode, but I have no idea how I got here and I'm reluctant to even attempt this on another machine.  I'm sure this is a fabulous product, but the install process is unbelievably bad.  The Kaspersky web site isn't much better.  I have not yet had time to find out what this AV interferes with, but messages here and on the forums warn me that trouble still lies ahead.  I hated Norton for this nonsense; Kaspersky hasjoined the ranks of those who fail to adequately test their install processes.  Good luck  More info: This is terrible software! After one week of use it consumed 250+ GB (!!!) of my C: drive, causing the system to stop and not be rebootable. That's criminal. It turns out that &#34;tracing&#34; is turned on by default, which causes this problem. There are instructions on the web site that show how to turn off tracing. You also need to turn off self-protection in order to delete all the files. (Incidentally, the web site doesn't seem to work in Chrome. I had to open it in IE11, which I generally don't use due to the risks involved.)   I lowered my previous 3-star rating to 1 star because of the disruption this caused to my work (cost me most of a day).  This is the kind of software that gives the entire industry a bad reputation.	2015-06-16

While the program allows you to select a currency for each account, account overviews add up all account totals as if they were US dollars with no currency conversion. It would be more useful if a currency conversion could be applied to foreign currency accounts. Since bank balances and stock prices can be updated automatically from online sources, there is no real reason why currency conversions could also not be updated.	2015-06-16

Every year I buy a new version of QuickBoooks Pro with Payroll because it's cheaper than renewing. The payroll portion did require that I call Customer Support, but they were actually very helpful and got me going very quickly, and I did not have to enable automatic renewal. I mention this because many people seem to complain about this process, but my experience was fine (as it was last year). BTW, make sure you write down the payroll key because you cannot retrieve it from the software by design.<br /><br />Make sure you save at least one backup before you upgrade - I lost all of my data from QuickBooks 2014 during the upgrade, but thankfully managed to restore it from a backup file. At the time, Intuit were having issues with the Synch server, so it might have been that.<br /><br />In terms of functionality, once you are used to how QuickBooks works, it's fairly easy to use and does the job. I am based in California, which requires you to file some kind of return to 3 different entities (Federal, State and EDD) pretty much every month and QB makes this quite easy once it is setup.<br /><br />The one thing that does annoy me is that QB seems to have trouble using files that are stored on a file server - it really wants them to be on the PC running the software. The reason I have the files on the fileserver is exactly so that they are not on the PC since I've so many problems with disk errors on PCs. I guess I'll just have to move it and make sure I back up every time, but even backups have issues with saving to a networked drive (it keeps complaining that the disk is full, but it's not even close).	2015-06-16

In recent years, the product has been excellent, but the 2015 edition didn't work on one of my computers, causing serious problems.<br /><br />I believe that the trouble is caused by Norton combining two previously separate products: Norton Internet Security 2014 and another program, Norton 360, that was used by businesses.<br /><br />When I downloaded it to my Windows 7 computer, the installation was bumpy, but the program did eventually get itself installed and working well. I was surprised that the installation seemed to have problems, as I have had no difficulties with Norton products in years.<br /><br />I also needed to install it on my old Windows XP2 computer, that I have been nursing along, until I can replace it. Norton Security has always run fine on it, until this year. Even though the Norton publicity says the program will run on Windows XP systems, I recommend against downloading it into a Windows XP computer.<br /><br />When I tried to download the program onto my Windows XP2 computer, the program first refused to download, demanding that I upgrade to Windows XP3. That requirement wasn't mentioned in the Norton publicity I saw. I do not want to upgrade the old computer to Windows XP3 from XP2, because I did that with another computer years ago, and the upgrade ruined the computer.<br /><br />I called Norton tech support, and a tech altered something in the registry, so that the Norton program would recognize my computer as an XP3, even though it is not. The program then downloaded, but I ran into new problems. The program refused to recognize my code that showed I had legitimately purchased the program. Since I had bought it on Amazon, that was pretty irritating.<br /><br />I called Norton tech support again, and they used their remote entry program to enter my computer and force the program to recognize the code. However, the program kept insisting that I hadn't bought it, and that my &#34;trial subscription&#34; had ended.<br /><br />I again called Norton tech support, and they used a remote entry program to try to fix this. A new problem developed. Their remote entry tech support program didn't like my home computer network, and kept severing the connection between my computer and the Norton tech, leaving the screen showing the conversation between me and the Norton tech on my computer's screen.<br /><br />The entire situation turned into a 12-hour nightmare, in which several different techs could not fix any of the problems, and they then inadvertently created more problems.<br /><br />I finally got a tech who was able to remove the Norton remote connection program from my computer and its screen. (I discovered through a search on my other computer that the program Norton currently uses for remote entry assistance is defective and sometimes operates like malware, leading to situations where it is difficult to remove from a customer's computer.)<br /><br />However, two subsequent Norton techs could not convince my computer that I had paid for the program, and it would not run on my Windows XP2 program.<br /><br />I have to say that Norton tech support tried really hard to resolve the problem, but I gave up after 12 hours. I removed Norton Security from the computer, and installed a free antivirus instead. It doesn't run well, but at least my old Windows XP2 computer is protected, until I can replaced it with a Windows 7 computer.	2015-06-15

The product is robust and lets you do almost anything you need to do to run your small business finances.<br /><br />Features I use regularly:<br />-Transaction tracking / accounting<br />-Bank account reconciliations<br />-Financial reporting (income statement, balance sheet, etc)<br />-Bank account &#34;feeds&#34; (bank activity downloads)<br /><br />Features I have used:<br />-Payroll<br />-State/Federal tax forms for employees<br />-Printing checks<br /><br />Using the desktop software comes out cheaper than the online version, which is why I own this program. I find updating about every 3rd year gives me the best new features without having to buy annually.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is how cumbersome fairly standard activities are, and how complicated it can be to learn how to do things the Quickbooks way. I have run into major issues (time sucks) with standard things like matching payments to customer invoices. Things like this should be simple, but are usually not intuitive out of the box.<br /><br />My second biggest complaint is how Intuit tries to leverage this program for advertising and sales. I can't get rid of some advertisements on software that I already paid for. I get using advertising on free applications like Mint, but when I already gave you money for this, quit trying to pitch new paid products like credit card processing and payroll.<br /><br />Overall, good and powerful, but not without its annoyances.	2015-06-15

As long as you don't expect something like Acrobat Pro to manipulate PDF files, this program is great. I only wanted something that could rotate and delete pages, build simple forms help organize my pile of PDF files. This programs does much more than that so it suits my needs very well. The only shortcoming I've found is the ability to rotate pages by degrees. It will only rotate to the quadrants 0-90-180-270 degrees, so I use Photoshop Elements (10) to make minor angular adjustments. Also, I wish I could change the color scheme to something other than the purple & magenta. Yuck! Still, a great little program!	2015-06-15

It is easily available for one-time use and it is also excellent for a full-time program. I use it for transcription and it works wonderfully! I have used the free version in the past, but recently I purchased the full version. It is so useful! Used with Fast Fox, a text expander or macro program put out by the same company, you can transcribe at lightning speed!<br />Express Scribe has an extensive help guide, but it is easy to use.I rarely need the guide, but when I do it is only a click away. No saving and looking for it later. The hyperlinks help you find exactly what information you need. The customer support is excellent as well. I had a glitch in my copy (which turned out to be easily fixed by uninstalling and reinstalling the program) and customer service answered within about 12 hours. For $39 software, that's great service.	2015-06-15

Lightroom saves so much more time and the results are so much better.  Photoshop is still the better tool for pure image manipulation.  But for straight forward RAW edits, I can't imagine a better workflow tool than this.  From backing up files, to re-applying like edits, to readying prints, Lightroom is very useful.  However, The application performance could be better.  It should really take more advantage of graphics cards like photoshop does; it doesn't seem to run as solid or stable.  But otherwise, this is a great gift for a digital photographer if they don't have it already.	2015-06-15

It works fine for a small fix. However, I think instead of offering an insignificant version, they should offer a free 30 day trial of the whole thing. They give us rather simple fixes that newer versions of windows can do without additional software. Meanwhile they dangle the real fix pieces in front of our noses, and demand that we upgrade to the real version for $50 or $60 bucks. Notifications are constantly popping up warning of necessary fixes that require our attention. If we try to run the fix, it offers a screen that hawks the full version. It is less informative and more infuriating and needs to be changed. I would never give my stamp of approval to a product that is this annoying.

What can I say that is bad enough to describe how terrible this product is?  This was pre-installed on my new laptop and, without notifying me it was going to do so, without telling me it was doing it, it stole copies of all my files and sent them to Norton's servers.  They called this a backup but a backup is something I control.<br /><br />I didn't ask Norton to steal my files and they did it silently and sneakily like the thief in the night that they are.  Only when it was done did I get a notice that they had backed up all my files and that it used 88% of 25GB of available backup space.  I'm on satellite Internet and I have a 25GB cap.  Now, for the rest of the month, I have Internet at model/dial-up speeds thanks to Norton stealing all of my Internet allowance along with copies of my most personal files.  They specifically target, as indicated on their backup web site, all of your financial files, your pictures, your videos, your documents, etc.  And they steal the entire &#34;users&#34; folder without regards to any privacy or security between users.<br /><br />I am a computer programmer and I have files in my downloads folder that are multi-gigabyte that I use for programming.  I downloaded them from their original sources and Norton felt they needed to back them up.  Why would I back up files I download from the Internet?  If I want them again I download them from their sources.<br /><br />My Internet provider has free usage from 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM. If I ever did want to backup to the Internet, I'd do it during those hours when it doesn't count against my usage cap - but I wouldn't use an automated online backup in the first place.  And I certainly wouldn't have used Norton's.  I have SkyDrive, I have DropBox, I have Google.  I have plenty of places already who want me to store my documents on their sites so they can datamine them.  I certainly didn't need another one that took my documents without my permission and without my knowledge so they could datamine them.  Norton must certainly do this so they can datamine and they steal the documents first and notify after so that even if you refuse their plot they will already have collected a copy of your files that will never be destroyed.<br /><br />I had used Norton since shortly after Peter Norton founded the company but it has been a long time since they were on my trusted list.  They are among the worst of the data thieves and malware.  It's my opinion that they use their expertise in identifying malware to give you malware.	2015-06-14

Turbotax has traditionally been one of my favorite software packages. Easy to use, clear explanations, etc. I don't mind paying extra to do my small business taxes, but this version was horrible this year. I was forced to upgrade the operating system on my Mac (about $89 extra cost, plus a couple of hours of upgrade time, plus having to learn the new OS and upgrading other programs, probably 10-15 hours lost), before I could use it. The machine is not more than 4 years old, this is just inexcusable. Furthermore, I wanted to open the file a few minutes ago, after filing my taxes, and it forced me to upgrade the software, just to view the already submitted file. This was another 20 minutes. I ended up just digging a paper copy out of my files. Terrible experience.	2015-06-14

When it did encode it, a 7 minute video came out at 500 MB. I re-encoded it with Handbrake and it ended up being around 55 MB. Quite a difference and no loss of quality with Handbrake.<br /><br />It has a lot of excellent features and is fairly easy to learn, but the crashing and the encoded size of videos makes it a deal breaker to me. I seriously doubt it was my computer causing it to crash. I have an X99 system with a 5930K, which can handle most any encoding program.	2015-06-14

When it doesn't, WATCH OUT	I bought this software from their website. I have been using this since June 2012 for my Kindle HD and a couple of Windows 8.1 phones that I've had. I needed something to sync my Contacts and Calendar to both. I tried Microsoft and gave up on them. It's a shame they can't sync their own software's data. Anyway, [[ASIN:B004UJ3AOK DejaOffice]] & CompanionLink offered a very reasonable solution. All I can say about it is,&#34;the software is great WHEN IT WORKS! When it doesn't, WATCH OUT!&#34; And, always keep good copies of your Outlook data that you can reload.<br /><br />Before reading any further, I suggest you go to the Product Description page for [[ASIN:B004UJ3AOK DejaOffice]] and look at the number of fixes on one release!! Does this give you confidence?<br /><br />The first problem I had was with DUPLICATES and TRIPLICATES. It was a mess! They opened a support ticket for me. Part of my complaint to them, explaining the problem, was, &#34;I have spent two days completely uninstalling/re-installing DejaOffice on my phone and Kindle. I have wiped DejaCloud several times, recreating it, as well as wiped the data on my devices, with no success. Although my Outlook on my desktop has remained constant, having no problems, DejaOffice on my Windows Phone and my Kindle keep producing duplicates [and triplicates] and it is impossible to deal with and our hands are tied because we can do nothing to correct the problems. It just messes up our entire work environment!&#34; They eventually provided a fix, but I wasted a tremendous amount of time!<br /><br />I am currently dealing with another problem. It is truncating FIRST NAMES that have more than one name, like: Mary Elizabeth, Ann Marie, Terri Ann, John Paul, Billy Jo, Pastor Bob, Cheap Frank, etc. I enter data this way because this is how they are called. I can begin with a new Outlook file (from a good backup), sync (one-way) Outlook to DejaCloud, wiping it first; then uninstall and reinstall DejaOffice on my phone, choosing to read (one-way) from DejaCloud and the data appears exactly as it should. If then I change the settings for both CompanionLink on my PC and DejaOffice on my phone to sync (push) both ways and automatically, and do something like add two new contacts to my phone and one appointment, I run into trouble! If the changes don't appear right away in Outlook, then I initiate the sync manually from CompanionLink. When the sync is completed (this was the first two-way sync on a new Outlook file) whatever followed the first name/word in the First Name field was truncated! This is a new problem! It has worked with my Outlook data for the past three years. It worked for 12 years using Nokia's PC Suite and then their Nokia Suite on my Nokia phones. They say they cannot recreate or duplicate the problem. It's like saying &#34;the problem is not ours, it's yours!&#34; They want me to duplicate the problem for them! Isn't that unbelievable! I'm just a user. I supply them with Outlook data. Once their software processes it, I actually loose some of it. Their software is ripping it away.<br /><br />I have literally spent days upon days restoring my data and trying to find work-arounds. I have over 1,200 contacts and thousands of calendar entries; but I always had these numbers. It's a big job! Things always worked. I also expect them to work if I am paying for the software.<br /><br />Like I said, the software is great WHEN IT WORKS! When it doesn't, WATCH OUT!<br /><br />UPDATE 09/29/2015: Eventually I personally concluded that this software was simply troubled and gave up. It wasn't a simply a guess. I was a Software Engineer mostly in OS R&D for 16 years. You can't always blame bad behaving software on your users, especially when you’re dealing with stuff like an Outlook database. So, I signed up for a trial period with AkrutoSync. Their website seemed to promise a lot. However, I did not like the setup process (a bit crude!) or how it worked (with IP addresses: 192.168.x.x assigned by the router) and its User Interface, but eventually got used to it and bought it. I have not had a problem syncing contacts, calendar, etc. in over 4 months now WITH THE SAME DATA DEJAOFFICE CANNOT! And that’s the same data that worked with the old Nokia PC Suite when I was using it. It is worth looking into. It's virtually trouble free, except when the IP Address changes (rarely with Netgear). It's not worth fighting with DejaOffice/CompanionLink Software or their staff. When their business collapses, maybe they'll get the message!.x assigned by the router) and its User Interface, but eventually got used to it and bought it.

In the past I've paid a professional on the order of $1000 to prepare my taxes for me. The amount of preparation work (gathering and organizing records) was slightly more bother with TaxACT than with the professional, because the professional has a well organized list for me to work from. But the savings with TaxACT more than makes up for the slight extra bother. I don't know if the professional would have saved me any money but the amount of tax at the end was pretty close to what I've paid in past years. So I'm pretty sure the savings in avoided preparation fees more than covers any potential tax savings. And either way the initial gathering of information is a big PITA so the slight increase in effort with TaxACT isn't significant.<br /><br />I've signed up for TaxACT for next years wrestling match. I just wish we could force our congress-critters to have to prepare their own taxes without any outside help. If we could we'd see an almost instantaneous simplification of the tax code.

However, for tax year 2014, given the huge difference in price between that Turbotax product and H&R Block's Premium and Business software (over $100 at the time of my purchase decision), I decided to give Amazon's PC-downloadable version of H&R Block's product a try. I expected to incur some &#34;learning curve&#34; time the first time using H&R Block’s product. However, I grossly underestimated the amount of time I would ultimately end up wasting and did not expect the H&R Block Business software to be as kludgy as it is. A few examples of the difficulties: (a) I figured out through some significant trial and error that the initial installation requires shutting down your anti-virus software firewall (the HR Block software froze several times until I figured this out, and I had to restart my computer each time to unfreeze the software), (b) processing of entries is much slower than in Turbotax, (c) the interview process is not nearly as seamless or as intuitive or as complete as the Turbotax interview process, nor is it is as visually attractive, and H&R Block's interview does not cause you to fill in every relevant blank in the 1065 (for example, the TMP's phone number); (c) the method of identifying and correcting errors in the H&R Block product is cumbersome; (d) the error review doesn't seem to pick everything up (for example, if you follow the interview process, which seems to force you to identify partner or partners having 50% or more interests before completing K-1s, you will end up reporting each of those partners twice in Schedule B-1, Part II with the result, if you have two partners at 50% interests each that you can end with a total of 200%-and the review process does not pick this up as an error); (e) you do not receive emails about efiling status and must go into the software to find out about it instead; (f) at leastas to MN, the state form (in MN, Form M3 and related forms) seems to be something of an afterthought-there is no interview and you cannot rely on the software to complete all the blanks and calculations and review the entries for errors (it seems that you essentially have to use the software for MN like you would a fill-in-the blank pdf form); and (g) you cannot efile with H&R Block's software in a significant number of states, including MN (in fairness, though, I have not compared H&R Block's list with the list of states Turbotax can be used to file partnership returns in this year). Even having now moved up the learning curve as to H&R Block’s Business tax software, I'll probably return to using Turbotax for Form 1065 use next year, particularly if Turbotax gets to be a little more competitive on price.	2015-06-14

Not only was I receiving MORE of the phantom hijacked web pages (back loaded onto Upgrade your Java or Adobe Now!) but the methods Kaspersky tech support sent me and which I followed diligently didn't work.  Not to mention that I spent more time following them than I would have by just deleting the phantoms.  At the end, my computer ground to a halt and refused to load any of my programs.  When attempting to scan with Kaspersky, I was prompted that my &#34;license&#34; was illegal.  That's when I uninstalled the program.  Things are humming along just fine now.  Fast boot.  Fast loading.  NO phantoms.  I would love to get my money back but that doesn't seem to be an option.  Here's my email response to the last email I received from tech support (June 7):<br /><br />the zip file is blocked<br /><br />this is taking way too much of my time and is still not fixed so I've decided to just close the hijackings when they pop up and forget about it.<br /><br />there is a virus somewhere that neither you nor malware bytes is able to find and delete<br /><br />ERGO I am deleting my efforts - it's just not worth it.	2015-06-14

Best features are: the price here on Amazon; the Optimizer button which finds junk files and registry issues in a couple minutes and deletes them; and the Quick scan is lightning fast compared to other products I've used in the past. I find it a little confusing to set up recurring scans and to stop scans in progress if I need to. Information for each function seems to be scattered in different places and I have to click several links to find what I'm looking for instead of having it all in one place. There is an Autopilot mode for when you're gaming or working on a project that is supposed to stop unwanted interruptions but the only thing that kept interrupting me was Bitdefender itself. You can switch it off, but then what is the purpose of it? I tried using Safepay for banking and online purchases, but it was very confusing and annoying to use. It kept interrupting what I was trying to do online and I ultimately turned it off out of annoyance.	2015-06-14

My husband purchased this as he needs assistance with the use of a computer secondary to ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease and cannot reach over a keyboard nor use the fingers except for the right thumb. This is his review:<br />Prior to Dragon Premium 13.0 I have been using Dragon Home 12.5. Currently I am writing this review using Home 12.5. Earlier today I uninstalled Premium 13.0 and reinstalled Home 12.5. The reason?<br />My major use for the computer is genealogy work and historical document indexing. The indexing work involves the use of a third-party database program. Using voice recognition software or else the on-screen keyboard that I can click using the mouse, I enter names of people, places and dates into fields in the database. This data is uploaded and made available throughout the world as searchable information on people's family history.<br />Home 12.5 allowed me to use correction and other commands that are part of Dragon within this database software. Since the Premium 13.0 was on sale, I thought that it would provide greater functionality. I was surprised to find that Premium 13.0 had less functionality. When I dictated a name of a place or person, 13.0 would not recognize the word that had just been placed into that field. As a result, I could not ask 13.0 for word correction nor could I teach within that software the correct spelling. The only way within Premium 13.0 to make a correction for a name, would be the use of the backspace command.<br />As far as using Dragon for email or Microsoft Office products, it did not make a noticeable difference whether I was using Home 12.5 or Premium 13.0.<br />System Resources<br />My System: Windows 8.1, 4 GB RAM, Core I 3 processor, 15 inch Asus Notebook<br />Uninstalling Premium 13.0, I learned that even when the software is exited, it remains resident in the operating memory of the computer. Windows was unable to uninstall Premium 13.0 until I used Task Manager to force-stop Premium 13.0. As soon as Premium 13.0 had been fully shut down, there was a reduction in system memory usage from 42% to 30%. When Home 12.0 has been normally exited there is not any significant overhead on the memory demonstrated.<br /><br />Conclusions:<br />Dragon Naturally Speaking software has been a useful tool for me. However the most recent version (13 .0), provides a fresh user interface, possible improvements in accuracy, but no improvement with actually a downgrade in utility with any applications outside of mainstream browsers and Microsoft Office. I am also concerned about the memory overhead demanded by version 13.0, even when the program is exited and not in use.13.0 had been fully shut down, there was a reduction in system memory usage from 42% to 30%.

Each year I am shocked at how additional errors come up -- meaning that more and more things *BREAK*.  (In software development, this is called 'regression.'  It is standard practice to test to make sure that new versions don't break already-working-things before you release it. It is abundantly clear that Intuit does *not* follow basic software engineering practices.)  Quicken 2015 has added features that add questionable value (&#34;Portfolio X-Ray&#34; &#34;Credit Report&#34;), introduced additional bugs, and not fixed errors from previous versions.  Here are some specifics:<br /> - Budgeting has been a fiasco. I fully expect that a financial product that has been around for this many years would have budgeting working flawlessly by now.  They had to do a major revision for this version to fix the horrible &#34;budgeting&#34; from the previous versions and it's still clunky.  This is inexcusable for a product this mature. Budgeting is *not* rocket science.  Or some new mysterious idea.<br /> - Intuit hasn't done simple things to improve usability that users have been asking about for years. For example:  why can't they show the computed difference between the financial institution (bank) balance and the quicken balance?  That computed difference is what is valuable information -- why make your users bring up a calculator and calculate it themselves each time?<br /> - The user interface does not make use of features and abilities that could make it so much easier to use for so many users.  They keep adding things to the user interface, but they haven't modernized it in many many years.  It's old and clunky and it shows. Compare it to something like Mint (which Intuit bought not too long ago).  It could be so much better, but instead is stuck in the past.<br /> - There have been bugs fixes for simple account balance errors!!  This would barely be excusable for version 1.0 of any financial software.  It's *definitely* not OK for financial software that has been around for so long!<br />- There are known bugs with downloading transactions (since at least Quicken 2012).<br />- &#34;Customer support&#34; is an oxymoron at best.  They simply go through basic help scripts and if they can't solve your problem with that, then you're SOL.  I have never had customer support successfully help with any issue or error.  The &#34;Quicken Support Community&#34; is where Inuit apparently expects users to solve their own problems.  A little time spent there will quickly show you the many on-going issues that users have and that Intuit has not addressed.<br />- Some updates to the product have been *automatically* applied -- you don't get a choice about whether you want to apply the update or not.<br />- As others have noted, Intuit does not fully disclose why you must create an online account -- they do not give you the option.  I do not user their online services or mobile syncing.  But the real issue is that Intuit does not explain what they do with the info *or* give you the ability to opt out.<br />- You cannot really stay with an older (more stable, more reliable) version because Quicken cuts off the ability to download transactions -- which is a huge part of the value of the product.  (This would be a totally acceptable practice if later versions didn't become even more buggy.)<br /><br />Instead of fixing known problems and being a mature, rock-solid, reliable product after all of this time, they continue to add &#34;features&#34; like the &#34;free credit report&#34; (which, BTW, has not worked for me or many others) or &#34;portfolio x-ray&#34; -- which is unusable to me because quicken cannot successfully add downloaded transactions to keep my investment accounts up-to-date.  They're the only game in town that allows you to connect to so many financial institutions and they know it.  They haven't put any real focus on making the product reliable, correct, and easy to use because they haven't had to.<br /><br />Beware of the overly-glowing 5-star reviews of this product that were posted before the product was even released or that only talk about how the installation goes.  (If they were beta-testers, why didn't they disclose it?)  Beware of the reviews that only talk about features and don't tell you about an actual user experience with the product.<br /><br />Most of all, beware buying Quicken 2015.  If you must buy it, keep your expectations low, expect errors when you do anything more than the most simple financial tracking, and -- like many of us -- keep your fingers crossed that a competitor will soon be viable enough that we can switch to a better, more reliable product.	2015-06-13

Program seems to work great now that I finally got the old file converted.  Conversion app would not work at all on Windows XP running on Parallels, nor could I get it to work on a different Mac running Windows 8.1 thru Parallels.  I spent many hours trying various options for saving files to different directories, etc. in Parallels and nothing seemed to work.  I was just about to give up and ask for a refund.  Finally tried on a PC laptop running Windows 7 and it worked like a charm.  Intuit really needs better online support for the conversion program - such as which versions of windows you need to use it, and maybe some work-arounds for other versions. Perhaps its not even possible to convert on a Mc running Parallels?? Would have been a lot higher rating if conversion worked the first time I tried!	2015-06-13

They cannot make either work for me. Ultimately, they end up saying: Give me access to your computer, so I can see what's going on. Right.

I don't recommend this product!	have been using TurboTax Premier since 1998. My experience last year: The company is dishonest and they do NOT stand behind their product.<br />When a company recognize there is a big error in their SW and send you an apology letter and ask you to send their SW product<br />back to them for a refund and the customer does ship the product with her/his own cost and then the customer get a letter from the company - oh! we are very sorry, we can't refund you the money because you didn't buy it directly from us...they were told I bought it from a third party not directly from the company website...and they keep the SW - should go out of business. I called them 3 times after a long hold ...asked to talk to a supervisor, they said supervisor will call me back..never got a call back. The whole dealing with this company take you to the black hole.<br />I never said this about any company - but I can say this with certainly! Don't buy Turbuo Tax.<br />Reasons/ my experience with Turbu Tax and Intuit:<br /><br />1). they cheated me. 2). they wasted many hours of my time 3). they still sale their product with the same error.<br /><br />TurboTax Premier flaw:<br />Income property sold and later within 6 months did an exchange (1031exch). With the SW it goes to calculate the capital gain from the sale - but does not take you to purchase of new property for 1031 exchange. So, the gain fro sold property does not get carry over.<br />The SW reflects a gain and show to pay tax on the gain. The forms and steps to tell it I bought an exchange property is lacking big time.<br />I ended up hiring a CPA and pay $900 for my tax return and never got my money back from Intuit.<br /><br />DON'T BUY INTUIT PRODUCTS - THEY ARE NOT HONEST - THEY WILL CHEAT YOU, when you need them! They don't stand by their product.<br />INTUIT should go out of business. There are other tax products out there to use/buy.	2015-06-13

For example it requires registration of the product - and there is no link to registration in the installed software.

I convinced myself I was &#34;saving $$&#34; but frankly... over the years... I have spent a lot of cash on hardware, software, updates and the constant need to buy new.  Finally I took the leap of faith and put a Mac on a store Credit Card and I am a BELIEVER!!  Mac is the only way for me!!!<br /><br />So, soon after getting my feet in the MacVerse I learned I wanted and needed to edit images and photos.  So, okay what do I do?  I did not know what software to buy or get free and so I read about this Fotor and looked at Reviews and thought ... heck let's give it a go!  And WOW  am I glad I did.  It is different than software I was used to.  I was using an old version of Dreamweaver Fireworks.  Now I thought that was the bomb and still love it.  But I have to say, this FREE software is awesome.  It takes a little getting used to and is not as fully editing as say Fireworks but look, it is Free so there are going to be limits as they do have a Paid FotorPRO version. It lets me do quite a lot of things that for the most part are all i need to quickly shift colors, crop, frame or add some effects to.<br /><br />To use it simply open it up and chose from one of the three options : Edit, collage, or Batch.  Then you have to select a per-existing image to use the Fotor. The Edit works on one image then you EXPORT it to save or send.  The Collage gives several options to place several images into one, and the Batch allows you to select a Folder to apply the same effects to all at once.<br /><br />I wish I could select colors or shapes to delete or change but again...I expect that with a fully paid software not a quick edit program such as this.  There are many options to stylize your pics and add text and make really quick automatic changes.  Just download it and take a look.  You can always throw it in the Trash can if you don't like.	2015-06-13

I've got a fairly new and powerful computer running Windows 7 but couldn't get the new PSE 13 to install from the download.  It kept saying I had a problem with my serial number.  I ended up buying a disk and tried to instalI the program that way.  Still wouldn't work so I brought my computer to a professional and it took him two hours to finally get it installed.  Recently I had the organizer lock up when I was trying to bring in a group off photos off my memory card.  I had to uninstall and reinstall the program to get it to work.  I think the programs in Photoshop are getting too big and complicated so there are always problems with installations, lock-ups, and error messages. Maybe Adobe should produce a smaller and more simple version that does all the basics but doesn't have all the problems!  I have been a loyal user of PSE.  I've had versions 3,4,6,10 and 13.  I'm going to have to explore what's out there before I upgrade again.	2015-06-12

It has you make and remake your resume per each employer, which is both tedious, and quite honestly when your trying to find a job, just downright depressing. You don't end up with the &#34;yes!

The resume making part of thesoftware looks to be geared towards people just starting out in their career and have no experience selling themselves for a job.

I asked the question whether the government's Roth TSP account would count towards the limits of the Roth IRA.  H&R Block told me that it would.  I am positive now after I have verified it that this is not correct and that these two limits are counted separately.

I used the free version for several years through several &#34;Operating Systems Du Jour&#34; and it worked great, cleaning up general crap that collects every time you use your computer. I finally, after using the company for free for so many years purchased the Pro version that works in the background quietly but only partially cleaning your computer. I use this program every time I begin to log off. First I will use a PC Tune Up tool that comes with an online tech service I purchased (much like one available through Geek Squad but mine is from IYOGI). I then clean all the cookies from my session using the tools portion of Chrome and lastly run a full scan using CCleaner. This sounds like it would take a while but it only takes about 3 minutes or so and it keeps my computer as fast as the day I bought it (and no one is tracking my computer usage!). I NEVER get a pop up, seldom get any spam and what spam I do get is from Vendors selling my email address after I make a purchase. This is a terrific program that really does help keep your computer clutter free no matter how much &#34;surfing&#34; you do. I HIGHLY recommend at least the free version and the cost of the Pro version is so small that it is very much worth it and allows you the use of the softwares updates which occur about every 2 weeks or so. Superb program even in its free form, the Pro version is MUCH better and is inexpensive!!	2015-06-12

I'm sure there is someone out there that actual notices and appreciates the changes that have been made since Office 2010 but for most people this is just a rip off plain and simple.<br /><br />  Microsoft realized that Office, in the way that most of us use it, is a very simple product.  By going with a $100 a year model they can leech a lot of cash off people too rich to care about that sum of money or too technologically unsavy to realize that there are free options out there.<br /><br />  If you aren't incredibly rich, you already own some (ANY) previous version of office made in the last decade, or you are open to going for one of the many free alternatives to office (Libre Office, google docs/slide/etc.) then you should not in a million years pay for a subscription to this product.

I've been using quicken for 15 years and this iteration is particularly maddening.  while there's a lot quicken 2015 can do, the program is clunky and unresponsive.  first, when upgrading from a previous generation (in my case quicken 2012 because the nice people at intuit won't support their programs after three years - buyer beware), the existing data in quicken home inventory could not be imported to quicken 2015.  i have done extensive research online and from what i can gather intuit changed the file format for home inventory data and there doesn't seem to be a way to convert it to the new format, one has to re-enter all the data from scratch.  the program for no apparent reason will seemingly randomly change your program to particular formats and default options which are different than what you have set as the default options in quicken &#34;preferences&#34; or to previous default options of the program itself.  intuit has a virtual lock on the personal finance software market with no serious competitors, and it shows.  They have little incentive it seems to create a top quality product or provide good customer service.	2015-06-12

Of all the things I bought in my life, this has to be the worst product. I had used Quicken for years on a PC. The Mac version is absolutely horrific. You are better off tracking expenses in Excel. Worst of all, my data file with over 10 years of transactions crashed.

This purchase was made because Intuit dropped online updating/downloading financials with 2012. The reason I bring this up is because if you purchase 2015 you will probably be forced, in three years or so to purchase the  current version of Quicken. Now having said that, I have been using Quicken for about 12 to 15 years so I obviously like the software. I think it works good its reliable and relatively easy to set up and use.  I would recommend with the caveat that you will have to upgrade to the new version when Intuit wants you to.	2015-06-12

I don't seem to be able to do that here -- there are 3 different types, and what you get is what you get. Not only that, but there's no way to format the report for printing in a format that works best for you.<br /><br />I've also found that the Help menu is not at all helpful. I wanted to set up a new car loan, and typed in Auto Loan, and got nothing. Had to open each available help topic to find the one that referred to -- you guessed it -- Auto Loans!<br /><br />And, much to my dismay, they have done away with \\"smart\\" categories (I think that's what they were called) which meant that you could assign specific categories to specific items and they'd always populate that way. For instance, I'm a gamer, and buy a lot of games from an online provider, paying for them with one of my credit cards.

I see that there are. My issue is recent 'updates' have played havoc with my passwords and especially categories. I have categorized my transactions for the past ten years! Over the past several weeks I'd notice that on different days random categories for transactions in my Checking account would simply be gone or 'transferred to unknown accounts.' When I go into my Category list I'd find gibberish categories full of symbols I can't even create with my keyboard! Categories like &#34;[] [] 89.&#34; I was concerned it was a virus, but a thorough virus scan showed no viruses. Then a few days later the categories would be OK. I got so frustrated I deleted the entire program and reinstalled without any updated to R7 or whatever it was. Then I noticed there was a brand new update version, so I downloaded that a few weeks ago. Now today, randomly, my categories are again missing! My backup is OK, but this is unacceptable for a financial software program that has existed for decades. Are you letting your new hires write this terrible software patches and updates? Your product keeps going DOWNHILL!!!	2015-06-11

Yes, the 2014 version was buggy, but in my experience 2015 is worse.  The only other time I had this degree of problems was in 2000 when I had to discard all of my old data.   Since upgrading to this very buggy version I have perhaps spent 90% of my time reconstructing data, restoring back-ups, working with my brokerage firms and trying the various suggestions posted on-line to resolve an unbelievable number of seemingly unrelated problems from crashes to incorrect column totals.  I find myself regularly performing the following operation: Click: 1 file, then 2 file operations, then 3 validate and repair, then 4 validate file, then 5 rebuild investing lots.  This will then tell me, among other things, that multiple securities and common indexes are dated a date in the future  (e.g. 2030).  I then have to go to those securities (which I may not have owed or used for years) and manually change their dates.  Following week, same problem, different securities.  My current problems include:  1. The portfolio section of Excel has a very nice “allocation” section which automatically calculates the percentage of your portfolio represented by different types of securities.  However, in my case the percentages are substantially different depending upon whether you look at their pie chart (which is correct) or their detailed pie chart (which is wrong) because the balances on the allocation report do not correctly total.  2. The Excel program advises on download that 3 securities split years ago and should I accept Excels placeholder entries. Excel will not accept no for a permanent answer.  If I say yes, then the balances don’t match my account.  I then have to make up a fictitious entry to make accounts balance but which makes my securities basis incorrect.    The fact that I continue to use Excelin spite of the above indicates that I like the program a great deal when it works properly.	2015-06-11

This year was an absolute nightmare.  Although Turbo Tax confirmed that our return was sent to and received by the Federal Government, it was not.  I also submitted our NYS Income tax at the same time and got a cryptic pop up telling me that &#34;I must file it at the same time as my federal&#34; (which I was doing).  It also said that I could file the State Tax separately but it would not allow me to do so and kept popping up the same message.<br />  A call to the Turbo Tax help line resulted in a 45 minute wait only to have the agent say &#34;Oh yes...New York State..a lot of problems with that one.&#34;  She then put me on hold for another 15 minutes.  When she returned, I heard her say &#34;I can't deal with this&#34; and I was disconnected.  Being April 15th, I was forced to file for an extension and then manually submitted my Federal and State Forms<br />  I am totally dissatisfied with Turbo Tax and especially with their no-help line which is an absolute joke.  It was a total waste of money and time for us.	2015-06-11

For step 1 I used some rudimentary digital flashcards made from First Aid, along with Pathoma videos, DIT videos and UWorld questions. I did not get through all the flashcards, but for the sections that I did, I scored very highly.<br />Overall, I got a 255. I have no doubt that if I had this program available I would have done much better. I wouldn't have had to stumble through cram, quizlet, and Anki (great programs in their own right) trying to compile decent board sources while using my homemade spaced repetition algorithm. I don't have the attention span to read a book, so after I get concepts from sites like onlinemeded, I like to beat them into my brain using these flashcards. The spaced repetition algorithm was good about 5-6 months ago when I first got these cards. Now it is amazing. The memorang team seems ridiculously dedicated to actually improving the program, revising the material, and listening to feedback from customers.<br />On top of that, the premade flashcards, such as this Step 2 CK deck, are ridiculously cheap. I was lucky to stumble upon them from google during my IM rotation. I couldn't believe how cheap they were, so I immediately bought the Step 1 and Step 2 flashcards. I think the real value of these cards is at least a few hundred, and I think I got in on the ground floor here.<br />Speaking of my IM rotation, I slackingly combined these with viewings of the onlinemeded videos, no UWorld questions or questions of any kind, and no other resources at all, and managed to hit an 86(mean 78, SD 8) on the shelf. I did best on those sections for which I had used sets of these flashcards. I know it's not a great score, but it makes you curious that if a slacker like me can perform a standard deviation above the mean, then imagine what a dedicated student can do.<br />On a final note to this rambling review, I think that these cards are gonna spread like wildfire among med students, just as onlinemeded currently is. So it would be smart to invest in them ASAP. I plan to return to both the step 1 and step 2 CK cards, and possibly even the individual shelf cards during residency to review the basics and the pathophys. Get em while they're cheap (and even after their monetary value reaches their real value).	2015-06-11

It was quite intuitive to navigate a completely new interface. There is however plenty of room for improvement.<br />- Took a while to figure out that to reconcile credit cards you now have to enter negative balance numbers. No possibility to click and drag over a bunch of transactions to reconcile them as in 2007 and earlier. 200 transactions means 200 clicks.<br />- This version is best understood if you consider that most of your transactions are going to be entered directly by download. Entering them by hand is a chore, as most of the intuitive and user-friendly arrow and tab navigation of previous version is gone. you have to click, re-click and again to do anything. Pressing the return key to get the result of a calculation gets you out of the transaction so you have to double-click on it again to check or continue. Maybe the one line transaction is not so great after all.<br />- Some flexibility and transparency/customization options in in the presentation would be welcome.<br />- Classes are gone, replaced by tags, or are they? If so where are they in my old data? Some help with the major changes in this version would be helpful.<br />This version looks like the beginning of a new approach to the software, and as such a bit clunky. Yet the guts are there, no major mistakes but hours of work to understand how to do things i could do quite easily before. This learning curve was un-necessary in most cases in my view.	2015-06-11

I'm an Adobe CC user and have always loved Adobe products, but this new DC version is terrible. Brand new &#34;Mystery Meat&#34; navigation/interface which doesn't fit typical PC or Mac standards, and they've taking some crucial things out. (Like when adding signatures then saving, it used to always default to saving in the same file location and automatically appending a -signed.pdf to the file name which helps when cranking through dozens of signed documents in a session - now every save has to navigate through this new file management interface)<br /><br />I had to combine a few PDF files the other day and that too was a trip down the magical mystery meat navigation tour. Took a couple of tries but got it. I'm afraid of having to do it again.<br /><br />Not a fan of today's new interface systems and Adobe DC is at the forefront of jacking everything up.<br /><br />I'm only giving it a 2nd star because it works and as I said, I love Adobe products.	2015-06-11

I use it predominantly to write and print checks for my employer's five accounts.  I managed to hold off ditching Quicken 2006 for years, but when I replaced my computer I had no choice but to upgrade to Quicken 2014.  I used to actually enjoy &#34;accounts payable batch&#34; days.  It was a vicarious thrill to spend gobs of money and whip out 150 checks in short order.  Now I dread it.  Earlier versions remembered the most recent check written to a payee.  I could immediately tell if I was entering a check already paid (sometimes checks and invoices cross in the mail).  This version only remembers the last time I &#34;memorized&#34; a payee.  So, let's say I memorize a check to ABC in January.  I write a check to ABC every month thereafter.  In every subsequent month,  Quicken will still be autofilling the January information (rather than the previous month's information like earlier versions of Quicken did).  Quicken 2014 is riddled with these little annoyances.  In the check writing pane, when I move from one account to another, it invariably stops me with the query &#34;Save last transaction?&#34;  If I press &#34;Yes,&#34; it saves a blank check.  If I press &#34;No,&#34; it allows me to continue.  Since I am jamming through a blizzard of bills, this distraction ticks me off.  The interface with my printer leaves a lot to be desired, and the ability to customize reports is weaker than any version of Quicken I have ever used.  I'm using a Mac and running Parallels with Windows 7 so that I can have my Quicken (the Quicken for Mac was such a holy-hell mess that I gave up on it after a mere two frustrating weeks).  I give it two stars because, at the end of the day, it does function.  However, I now spend a lot of time researching other check writing software, hoping to find something better.  With Quicken's descent into terrible mediocrity, I expect that something better willbe along soon.  I'm so disappointed that a once spectacular software has degenerated into this clunky, user-hostile piece of junk.	2015-06-11

I was unable to access my data for WEEKS. Hours of wasted time on the phone with very poor customer support. Quicken has since pulled the update and released a patch, but the patch did NOT unlock the data. Quicken support could not unlock it, even after a week. I had to restore a previous backup -- then rebuild the data through bank records.<br /><br />I'm not the only one to go through this.

First, the developers should be fired for releasing an update without sufficient beta testing. Second, the poor customer support has turned me off.

This product seemed really nice at first. The ratings for the antivirus portion are tops, and it has features that are designed to protect your identity and privacy. However I think the program still needs some work. It may have been a coincidence, but after the installation I started experiencing annoying errors such as corrupt dll files which had to be researched in order to fix. And then the product apparently activates the clearing of your virtual memory page file at shutdown. This clearing action causes your shutdown to go from mere seconds to about 60 seconds. Not really a huge deal, but annoying all the same.

In the years since many have seen and used the later versions of XP, VX, and VX Ace. I have personally spent hours upon hours trying to make even the tiniest of games and there is always this wall that comes up blocking further progress. This was generally due to either a lack of more ideas or complete hard drive crashes and the loss of data.<br /><br />Though with the availability of massive, cost-effective hard drives, the latter has not been much of a problem these last few years. So when someone honestly says “oh you just made that using RPG Maker” they generally have no real idea of how much time and effort still needs to go into making such a project. The time building the environments, the time scripting events and cutscenes, and the time getting combat “just right” to not have it too easy, too hard, or just plain boring. All of this is even before getting into the more custom sprite making, music and battle systems.<br /><br />Before getting into details, the most important factor is to understand the manner in which RPG Maker 2003 is designed. Any game, RPG, Action RPG, Action, Platformer, you name it, has three distinct layers. Each of these layers have their own specific use and must be designed accordingly if the final project is to succeed.<br /><br />The first layer works like the ground as it defines where the eventual player can or cannot move. Straight paths, winding corridors, walls or no walls to define these paths that is your choice to make. The layer above this one is where a user can throw in obstacles and decorations such as beds, chairs, barrels, statues and other fun stuff to make players move around. The final layer is perhaps the most or least important depending upon how you see it. This is where users can enter script for events, cutscenes, transitions, change random battles for on screen enemy battles that you run into and so on.<br /><br />The interface in RPG Maker 2003 is simple and clean which is a staple of the RPG Maker series. Just about any required tool or option can be found either on the left side of the window with the available tileset or all along the upper taskbar leaving the majority of the window for the user to design their adventure. The tilesets take up about a quarter of the left side of the screen along with the project’s name and area maps which are all easily accessible with a simple click of the mouse. The maps can be easily dragged-and-dropped as needed or even put under another one which indents it in the list to show the user, or another collaborator, that those maps are part of the one above it.<br /><br />Moving on to much more fun things than the interface, comes the actual construction of the game. I will be honest and say that anyone that has ever used MS Paint or Adobe’s Photoshop will find themselves right at home with the following options.<br />-  The Pen tool to draw tiles one click at a time;<br />-  The Rectangle tool form a rectangle of the selected choices;<br />-  The Oval tool which is like the rectangle but more circular; and finally<br />-  The Fill tool that will fill up any space that is attached to it.<br /><br />While the above might not sound like a lot of available options, they get the job done rather quickly and efficiently. Some of you, by this point may have realized that I never said that there was an eraser to remove anything that was unwanted and this because instead of being part of the selection tools is instead part of the tilesets. Unfortunately this means that the Eraser can change places depending upon which level of the tilesets you are looking at. It would have been nice to have a dedicated Eraser tool, but at the very least there still is an option for it.<br /><br />After you initially build your first environment(s), which will be an ongoing process because it is never really finished as there is alwaysgoing to be that “one last thing” that you will want to add or modify, comes the placing of events. Because I could literally be here until next week writing about what events can do, I will try to keep it brief (but feel free to comment below for more information!).<br /><br />Events are multifaceted and exist to make everything work from more than just moving around the map. These control possibilities and absolutes, from allowing a player to move into a house, from the village into a field or a cave, fight an encounter as long as they have talked to Town Persons A-B-C and walked around the well three times counter-clockwise, to no longer being able to enter a shop because you irritated the owner. All of these options, and more, can be set within one event square with commands that can be input into a window from a series of available choices.<br /><br />To say that there are a lot of options would be an understatement; unlike the VX Ace version that I recently used, the RPG Maker 2003 does not have sections that break up the options under headers to make them easy to find. This could create a bit of a challenge when trying to remember which option was on which tab and how far down the page it was. While this is not the end of the world, it could certainly make the things much more time-consuming. There are a few items that could have been updated for the re-release such as the ability to set the Face Graphic while inputting the text instead of having them both as separate actions which can really fill out the Contents window very fast.<br /><br />(RPG Maker 2003 Event Windows compared to RPG Maker VX Ace)<br /><br />These really are only minor details, but they are minor details that do add up over time but in regards to how much time has been spent and sometimes into how frustrated you can become before really needing to take a break from the project.<br /><br />The final gear that makes everything work is the database. This acts as the central storage unit for every ounce of data from your characters and enemies to animations and tilesets. In here just about any modification can be done. A perfect example would be for anyone who’s playing Final Fantasy IV when Cecil goes from being a Dark Knight to a Paladin. This would have been two separate entries in the database with an event handler that would switch over his sprite, his experience and level, his base stats, and his equipment the moment he defeats his darker self.<br /><br />RPG Maker 2003 is a great software that is rather easy to use but has a learning curve to figure out exactly what everything does.

Big mistake! I was able to set it up as new, but in contradiction to the blurb, couldn't import the data from MS Money. Anyway, I eventually set up the various accounts and the banking data manually, and now after a year of use -  1). It crashes so often that I have learned to save the file after every single reconciliation. I contacted the help desk chat line, who had no explanation, but said I should force quit it every time it crashes and then re-start it. Takes ages. MS Money used to &#34;guess&#34; the details of repeated transactions pretty well, and fill in the details after typing the first word or so. This app frequently gets it wrong, and inserts the wrong information, so I have to carefully go through every individual transaction and change the details in every 2 or 3 (which I have to repeat if/ when it crashes before saving). Every month it takes as least twice as long to check my monthly accounts as MS Money used to. I tried to upgrade , but got a message that the upgrade couldn't work in Mountain Lion - only Yosemite. I thought Apple products were supposed to be backwards compatible, for at least a year or 2! In short, this app is the my only regret that I am no longer using a Windows system.	2015-06-11

I have been using Quickbooks for many years. Over the years, my opinion of Intuit has gone steadily downhill. I am quite certain that Quickbooks management does nothing but sit around and dream up new ways to screw their customers. Due to the high cost of switching, they know they have current users by the gonads. So they keep looking for new ways to get more money out of customers. Of course every business does that. But Intuit manages to do it in the most heavy-handed and annoying ways possible.<br /><br />I used to upgrade Quickbooks every year. (Of course Quickbooks comes out with a new version every year, whether they have any real improvements or not.) My accountant recommended it because the first year used to include free payroll updates. Quickbooks put a stop to that. No big announcement. First, they just made it nearly impossible to get it to work. Calling their tech support, I was forced to talk to 5 different people who all told me that I had to pay for payroll and they'd be happy to sign me up. Only after explaining for the umpteenth time that the box still said it was included free for a year did someone finally tell me how to get it to work.<br /><br />Then the next year there was no free payroll even with a new version. Then they limited payroll to only 3 users unless you paid a large premium to increase the number. So I stopped using their payroll calculators. I found that I could quickly calculate payroll myself using paycheckcity.com and put the numbers into Quickbooks.<br /><br />The ability to import banking data saves a lot of time. Now in June 2015, I find that my 2012 version of Quickbooks no longer allows me to import the file I've downloaded from my bank. Supposedly this is because Intuit no longer &#34;supports&#34; my 2012 version. How is the active disabling of functionality equivalent to no longer supporting an older version? This is just evil. It is bad enough that support ends after only 3 years, but to disable functions that requireno &#34;support&#34; on their end is totally uncalled for.	2015-06-11

I also had to buy an additional state package which cost another $39.

I was perfectly happy with Quickbooks 2012 and tonight they deleted the function to import directly from a bank. I've also not appreciated that in their upgrades they often take away features just to add them back years later, or not at all.  This is primarily a very NEGATIVE review of Intuit.

All files have to be manually uploaded. If you go into a folder on your PC and make a change you have to then open a browser window and copy that file manually. Frankly, it's amazing that Amazon couldn't come up with a way to automate any of this. Even if they didn't want to come up with a job that scans your system for updates all the time they should have an app that would let you kick off a manual scan to get things in sync. It's a real time waster as it works today - and it's all too easy to forget to make that manual copy, so the whole point of a cloud backup is greatly diluted.<br /><br />Very disappointing, Amazon.	2015-06-10

Inexplicably, they've removed the ability to edit memorized payees. So, import your bank statement. Quicken categorizes, say, your paycheck with a single category. But you need to add categories for all the deductions (Fed tax, state tax, SS, etc.). One by one you type them in. Guess what? Next time you import a statement, for that exact same payee, you'll have to re-type all of the categories in the split. Same is true for non-split transactions. For a memorized payee, there's simply no way to permanently change the category applied.<br /><br />You could do this in 2007 and previous versions by editng the &#34;Memorized Transactions&#34; list. In their wisdom, Intuit has done away with this. Quicken support claims that it will apply the last used categories, but that does not happen.	2015-06-10

I purchased Bitdefender directly from the Bitdefender website last year.  For a number of months, the product seemed to run decently effectively. Then all of a sudden I start having weird issues where I can't access any HTTPS: websites because of a certificate error. I'm a pretty tech savy guy and this one had me absolutely stumped. After spending hours and hours (and I mean HOURS) searching the internet, reading tech support chat logs, etc. I finally came across a random reference to a person with the same problem who thought he had connected the dots because his Bitdefender license expired and he switched to a new antivirus. It turns out their SSL scanning tool works by spoofing valid certificates - brilliant - and that means you can't access any HTTPS websites - even more brilliant. OK, no big deal just turn off the SSL scanning feature - no problem. EXCEPT IT IS LIKE A FREAKING VAMPIRE. It says it is off, but it is still active, you actually have to toggle it on and then back off to get it to actually turn off - every time you reboot the machine. So I contact Bitdefender tech support, they tell me that the problem is that I have malwarebytes installed on my machine, uninstall malwarebytes, repair bitdefender. I do so and the issue goes away... for about 2 days then it comes back. I review all programs loaded on my machine - there are no other forms of antivirus, antispyware, etc. so no blaming other peoples scanning tools. I try repairing a few more times. I try a couple of full uninstall / reinstalls. I try to use Bitdefender's (junk) Bitdefender removal tool - it gets caught in an infinite loop each time I try it. I try to contact their (atrocious) support / help - their response times are averaging about 2 weeks per contact.  They instructed me to run their support tool so it can capture data from my computer and then upload it to the ticket. I try to do that - it creates a 750MB file, which can't be uploaded. I write them back, 2+ weeks later: oh please usethis third-party service to upload the file.  Said service is limited to 300MB for the free service. I write-back asking for alternate directions... no response. I finally just say - fine I'll live with it for another month and a half until my subscription expires and I'll go with another vendor. I'm living with it... A couple of weeks go by. My wife calls me from a business trip, her laptop won't access her company's exchange server... company IT can't figure out what's happening... I try and help her over the phone for a while - no luck and then on a random guess I ask her to go into the Bitdefender and check to see if the SSL scanning is on... bingo... turn it off and she can use Outlook again.  This is a completely different machine, different operating system, etc. Seriously, what kind of cr5p software is this?<br /><br />Oh and I am REALLY thankful for another reviewer who pointed out that when you purchase this (junk) software from Bitdefender directly that they transfer you to Avangate to actually purchase the software and that Avangate by default turns on auto renewal.  I had to go and request an Avangate login be created (when you order Bitdefender, a Bitdefender account is created - not an Avangate account) and then access my Avangate account settings - yep Autorenewal for Bitdefender on by default.  Tell me that isn't SHADY.  Nothing about that in any way stated in my account informatoin at Bitdefender.com.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE - I'M SERIOUSLY QUESTIONING CNET, ETC. AND THE HONESTY OF ANTIVIRUS REVIEWS IN GENERAL NOW.	2015-06-10

It won't accept my password when I try to log in.  I have now reverted back to a previous backup again, will have to reenter a lot of previously completed work again.  I try to reach out for support but the chat window doesn't work (it wants me to choose my product but the drop down menu doesn't work) and the phone support is only available from 8am-5pm (while I'm at work and not able to come home and sit in front of my computer to get support!)  You would think that a company that had any real concern for customer support would expand their support hours while such a major company mistake is taking place.  Working with Quicken has just been frustration after another frustration.  If I have to revert to a previous back up one more time I am just going to uninstall and find another program to use.	2015-06-09

This is a godsend (probably from Irving, God of Machines--though maybe electronics fall under the egis of a different god), but a) it's slow; and b) it needs two widgets: one a Duplicate Finder, and one a comparison panel like FastStone's that lets you isolate two to four selected images so you can compare them and choose, all online.  Otherwise, you have to get your files sorted BEFORE you upload them, and a cloud should let you upload a massive folder, edit it online, and once it's as you like it, download the nicely sorted version back to your machine/device after you've sent the original to recycling. That way your OS doesn't go so nuts, you don't get locked out of your own files, etc.  Just be aware that Amazon's cloud doesn't like LARGE pictures such as the portrait you saved at 600 dpi because you want it as close as possible to the original.  Or videos over 20 minutes, not that I have the latter issue.  The way it syncs with my Kindle is still amusing, and I must do something about that!  Maybe I meant &#34;bemusing.&#34;  Still, I can shuttle photos and drawings back and forth between my laptop (Windows 7) and my Kindle Fire HDX and my Canon MX922 (via PrintHand), and maybe not even have to get out of bed to do so!	2015-06-09

Functions well until the smallest thing goes wrong.

So far I am getting used to the changes in the user interface...feeling my way around the changes.  I tried to see if I wanted to use the mobile app, but did not see any real advantage, so I uninstalled the app.  For some reason, 2015 duplicated 2 of my accounts...it took some doing to understand which had the complete historical data.  I think I have that figured out.  I have traditionally not used the feature of automatically downloading data from my bank and I think I will stick with that.  I also no longer try to keep up with investment accounts.  Maybe with being retired I may try to clean up some of the older data in my file...time will tell.<br /><br />I moved to 2015 because I was sure that intuit was about to discontinue support of 2008.

In addition to forcing we Deluxe version buyers to upgrade after the fact (which is why the refund - the protest has been huge) there are significant problems I have found in this version of the software.<br /><br />I find several problems in working on business info, particularly with two businesses.<br />1) Some historical data, such as the date I bought a car used in business is missing from the Step-by-Step (SS) info even though it is on the form.<br />2) The individual SS screens are not displaying some data I have entered directly on the forms this year. In fact they don’t even continue to show data I have entered directly on the SS this year.<br />3) Step-by Step doesn’t show which of the two businesses I am putting data on for some screens (but it correctly identifies the business on others).<br />4) Using SS, for the second business, many of the pages that come up for the first business are missing. For example I am not askedgiven an opportunity to enter any of the home office expenses on SS, so I have to enter them directly on the form. Luckily I caught the error. It could have cost me a lot of money.<br /><br />I have found glitsches in the past on TurboTax, I have been using it - mainly the Deluxe version -- for many years.

BitDestroyer (I mean, BitDefender) deleted some of my software without warning, shortly after scanning it and saying that it was ok.

So you know, I have owned this software for over a month and have spent a good deal of time with it.  My point is that I'm not judging this software off the cuff;  I had problems with it shortly after I started using it, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt...for weeks.  The upshot is that the software is buggy and fails without providing error messages.  The worst is that the software has a serious glitch which prevents it from building a final video when you try to use common special effects.  I contacted Corel and they gave me the run-around...sending me from technician to technician and finally to 'engineering'.  I followed each and EVERY recommendation Corel made...even purchased a brand new computer!!! And the glitch never went away.  Corel never fixed the problem, finally dropped me by telling me to go to a link that would give me the status of my case...but the link doesn't work!<br /><br />This speaks VERY poorly for this company's product quality and customer service.<br /><br />If you buy this product, just hope you don't need to use the features that cause it to fail...Only use it for very simply video editing!	2015-06-09

I've been using Quicken Deluxe since 2009 after Microsoft Money was discontinued.  The installation of Quicken Deluxe 2015 was smooth upgrading from Quicken Deluxe 2012; but getting my accounts to connect to the financial institutions and brokerage accounts was not smooth.  I had to reset all of my accounts so I ended up losing a lot of historical data.	2015-06-09

I have about 300 DVDs but only room to easily access about 30 of them, so I bought several 3 TB hard drives and ripped (actually I'm still in the process) the DVDs to my computer and then put the DVDs in storage (not a job for the faint of heart).  I used WinX DVD Ripper for the vast majority of the ripping and had very few problems ~ 95% success ratio.  There are a few programs that I've tried (with time limited free trials) that worked as well or perhaps even a little better at ripping but cost $50 or more as well as having other minor issues I disliked.  Given the user friendliness, reliability, and features (and lack of a few I would like to see), I have to stick with 4 stars.  Software would pretty much have to be perfect before I would give it 5 stars.  For the price, it does a decent job.  I am confused by some of the poor reviews.  Maybe they are from older versions.	2015-06-09

I've used Norton in one form or another for years and despite some minor issues I find it it has served me well. In my opinion it has progressed from bloated(some years back) somewhat intrusive software to a fairly low profile internet security program that works well with the kind of internet browsing that I am accustomed to. I have the same gripes as many reviewers in regard to marketing(forget automatic  renewal, you always pay more,no reward for being an existing customer). I've been buying at Amazon for some time, always saving a good chunk of money for my version until this year when with the new combined version the savings weren't there, but at the Amazon checkout I got a $20 promo discount from Norton  and picked up the 5 device for around $26, a great deal. It's also very convenient having it in your software library to for future use on new devices, or to reinstall. Be aware the installation process is a little confusing now as you now have only the software key in your library. The link to the actual software download is gone and you need to use or create a Norton account after being directed to their website and downloading the program from there. The process is not that complicated but is a little confusing, just look for the link to the Norton website and if you have a Norton account already log in and you're all set. From there my installation went flawlessly, old version removed automatically and after a reboot the new version installed in a few minutes and was up and running with absolutely no issues.I really have had good luck with Norton although I don't use every feature. Over the years it has stopped several browser hijacks,viruses, trojans, and I'm on the internet a lot.I like the fact it tells you when it's blocked an intrusion attempt so you can get out of there fast. I do occasional stand alone scans with other products(Malwarebytes, microsoft security scanner,etc.) and have never found a single thing it missed.Never firewall issues when installing applications.Having said all these good things I also understand that others have had terrible experiences with installation and customer support.Sometimes something just doesn't work good on your computer. This has happened to me in the past and although each time it was resolved I know it is a real pain when something goes wrong. Please do a complete image backup of your computer before installing any security program like Norton because you are giving it a lot of control over your computer. Then if you can't get it to work your not locked into trying to fix it, just restore your image and try something else. Anyways, I recommend Norton highly, it's worked well for me and I think it's got better over the years.That's my two cents-good luck.	2015-06-09

It's new, it's different, and that about sums up the positive attributes.<br /><br />Scaling in Windows 8.1 on high resolution screens is laughable. Riddled with buttons so small I can barely distinguish them from a smudge. Quicken will blame windows, but most of my other programs (often free or significantly less expensive) avoid these issues so it's pretty clear who is to blame. I have to change the resolution for my entire windows experience just to get this one program to look slightly less horrible.<br /><br />A frequent occurrence: Press a button and notice that nothing is happening...at all...not even a spinning icon to tell you to be patient. Perhaps 20 seconds later the screen flickers and you think, &#34;Ah! You ARE doing something!&#34; Eventually, a new window appears or a belated spinning icon confirms your vague suspicion that your trackpad is indeed still working. This on a brand new ultrabook where every other program flies.<br /><br />It happened to me yesterday: I want to change my Wells Fargo username. How can I do this? Perhaps a button in my account settings that says, &#34;Change Username&#34;? Oh no, silly, you need to begin by disconnecting your accounts from their ability to download transactions. Only then can you reconnect them and have an opportunity to give a different username. It's about like being told my front door is just fine because while there is no knob to open it, one can easily remove the hinges and gently lower it to the floor in order to exit the building.<br /><br />It happened to me...again: This isn't new to 2015, it's just the way Quicken has always been. I've had the product for just a few months and suddenly I'm facing numerous duplicate transactions and the familiar question, &#34;They are both identical, so which one do I need to kill in order to keep it from coming back?&#34; Operating this software is like spoon feeding a gremlin. You can try to be nice, be gentle, move slowly and try to avoid eye contact, but eventually it's going to spit food on the wall and try to bite your fingers off. Ha! And you have to pay for the privilege!<br /><br />My question: Is the software development at Intuit in a state equivalent to overseas clothing sweatshops? At a time when software can be amazing, how can a product like this be so woefully disappointing except by a stringent commitment to spending money on advertising rather than development, and making sure those developers are the cheapest money can buy (possibly to the point of being exploitive)?	2015-06-09

Just say no to updates!	I've been using this product on a Mac for 18 months now;  for the last 12 it has been my primary work machine.  Perhaps it worked better before, but these days it's like having the familiar Microsoft experience on your Mac:  the Mac that has worked so well and smoothly just doesn't work in so many ways when you contaminate it with Microsoft software.  Some features have simply never worked, like \\"Show Recents\\" in the Dock.  Other features mostly work.<br /><br />I think the most outstanding feature of this software is that I have reinstalled my Mac twice in the past 6 months because of bad updates.  In about March, Office stopped working properly after an update and AppleCare told me to reinstall the OS, relying on my trusty Time Machine as a backup in case of trouble.  Somewhat disbelievingly, I did as they asked, and the experience was smooth and easy (just like reinstalling on Windows has never been).  And suddenly Office worked again.  Then yesterday I allowed Microsoft's Update Tool to update me to the latest release, which I figured had to be safe since it was almost a month old.  I was wrong:  no Office apps would start, or in fact do anything beyond an initial half-bounce.  No errors, no process creation I could easily observe;  an amazingly silent and undiagnosable failure.  Microsoft Error Reporting did not start and had no knowledge (indeed, I think it may have been implicated according to some posts I read).  So I Google'd the update (14.5.0 I believe), and lo and behold, it's been known to make Office inoperable on some Macs and Microsoft has simply left it up for auto update anyway.  Unfortunately, instead of calling AppleCare immediately, I followed the directions from a helpful post and dragged Office to the trash.  Once I did that my Time Machine would not restore it for some reason (apparently it's been not feeling well for a while but has been mostly functional), and the solution recommended was to recover my entire Mac from Time Machine.  So I did, and so now it works again.<br /><br />(Well, except that I forgot I wasn't backing up my Windows VM, and so now I have the same old Windows experience in spades as I recreate the VM from scratch.  Like I say, they bring the \\"it just doesn't work\\" experience to your Mac anytime you don't want.  I hear they are working on redeeming themselves, but Microsoft has a long way to go to re-earn my trust.  (BTW, if you're curious, I have a Ph.D. in computer science and used Windows for over 20 years before I just had enough and decided it worthwhile to give Apple my hard-earned money.))<br /><br />In all fairness, I do have to admit that I first installed Office 365 for the free trial, then downgraded to Office 2011.  Since Office 365 doesn't have an uninstaller on the Mac, uninstalling and downgrading is a bit intense.  Perhaps that somehow corrupted things, although it's impressive it survived an OS reinstall and a reinstall from backup.	2015-06-09

This Quicken version sucks!  I went back to 2014 Deluxe.  A nice feature of the 2014 version is the  ability to sort the uncleared transactions towards the end of the register.  Well, developers of 2015 Deluxe took that feature away.  For me, it's almost equivalent to having a car with electric windows, and then going back to manual.  I recommend keeping your 2014 version.  And, if you're new to Quicken, well, keep a close eye on the customer comments, as the latest versions are not always the best.  Enjoy!	2015-06-08

When it upgraded my 2012 version database though, it created some issues for entries that had information from accounts that had been removed in the past, which created issues for several accounts causing wildly incorrect balances.  When I would do online updates with accounts, it included very old generic entries from these past corrupted entries, even after removing the bad entries after integrity checks.  It took a few weeks of doing this a few times before it's stabilized now and having had to make adjustment entries for my accounts to get them back to the proper balance.  Have never had an issue like this when upgrading before, and have been using Quicken Deluxe for over 10 years.  Hopefully everything will work properly from here on.	2015-06-08

It does excellent recognition of fairly complicated documents (2 column docs in fairly poor image resolution).<br /><br />However its interface to scanner is so deficient, that you will likely have to resort to other software to scan paper documents. Here are the problems in build 12.0.104.167; Part #1132.25:<br /><br />1. Scanning Letter pages (8.5&#34; x 11&#34;) from automatic document feeder, results in oversized PDF pages (8.53&#34; x 11.72&#34; or even Legal size). Using other scan software via native TWAIN interface creates correctly sized documents.<br /><br />2. Scanned/recognized pages are often reordered (20 pages ADF scan on 4 CPU PC); sometimes a page is duplicated. When OCR an already scanned document, no reordering occurs.<br /><br />3. Scanner interface does not allow selection of paper size, nor the scanner interface allows access native dialog of the TWAIN driver.<br /><br />4. There is no function to crop oversized pages.<br /><br />5. Technical support while responsive, could not reproduce any of the errors, but suggested buying FineReader 12.<br /><br />Summary: It is good to have as a backup solution for OCR of complex documents, when your primary PDF editor (e.g. PhantomPDF) does not provide adequate OCR, but not very useful as the primary application for digitizing paper documents.<br /><br />It is sad that an excellent OCR backend is buried by failure to provide a simple and robust interface to a scanner.	2015-06-08

I just checked and there are 14 hot keys. These guys really seem to want to produce a quality product. One thing I would like to see is a hot key to change download directories. It would be cool to change to a directory and have the saved file name the same as the directory. I bought this from them directly because I wanted them to get more of a share of the purchase price. They also offer a portable version and I could use it on all of our computers but I don't want to screw a group of people who cares enough to really make a good product.

I just did my taxes for 2014 yesterday but I purchased the software 6 weeks ago at a local store on sale. I have used Turbo Tax for over 20 years but now I am done with them. Unlike many reviewers that post in December or January I don't review software that I haven't used. I used this software and in the end I wish that I had purchased something else. My review is based on actual experience and not just a review to garner votes by posting early.<br /><br />I had numerous problems and it took me twice as long to do my taxes as it should have. It kept asking the same questions over and over and I filled out the boxes and when that section was completed none of the dollar figures or answered questions showed up as correct. The most glaring was when it asked me if I had prepaid estimated taxes and I answered yes. It then asked me what amounts and I filled in the quarterly payments. When done it did not include those payments in the refund calculation and I had to manually override the data and fix it. This one mistake alone would have cost me $1200. If I had not been watching the refund amount at the top of the screen I might have missed this error.<br /><br />I used the walk me through format as I normally do and this year it was just garbage. It would ask me if a set of circumstances would apply to my return and I would answer no and then it would proceed to ask me 20 to 30 questions to which I have already answered that they did not apply. When I answered yes to a section and answered every question and filled in numbers, when appropriate, it would not use the data or the numbers and I had to go back and fill out the data and numbers again. Very time consuming and frustrating.<br /><br />Ultimately I had no trust in the way this software worked and I rechecked every number and calculation before I filed. Like I said before, one error alone would have cost me $1200. When I was completed it did a scan and it found a mistake, or so it claimed. It told me a number for my 2013 taxes was not entered correctly and I checked it and it was correct. I even looked at the actual printout of my 2013 taxes to verify the number. To make matters worse it truncated the code for the local tax authorities for the county that I live in making it almost impossible to determine what it was even questioning. It stated the taxes paid to INC were wrong when the code is IN C-41. I had to manually go back to the forms and fix the error that really was not a problem and it had no bearing on my 2014 return. A simple waste of time for what it called a data collection form.<br /><br />Doing taxes is not really fun and wasting twice as much time as required makes it really a hassle. Turbo tax has lost a customer that has been loyal for over 20 year back to the days of Turbo Tax coming to you on floppy disks.<br /><br />On top of that, go look at the recent 5 star reviews. Many of them are first time reviewers posting 2 words to one sentence reviews. They use no punctuation and no capital letters. They are fake reviews. How can you trust a company that does that because they are in trouble?y 2013 taxes was not entered correctly and I checked it and it was correct.

If I could give this product ZERO stars I would.<br /><br />I bought this to convert a .mov to .wmv file. It converted the video just fine, but stopped playing the audio after about 2/3 of the video. Over 15 messages to Aiseesoft Product &#34;Support&#34;, has left me with a $35 expense that can't be recovered AND a boatload of wasted time trying to get them to step up. Their support team seems to have a scripted response that doesn't really take into account why their software is a dud.<br /><br />In addition, they need better documentation for their SW. The product does not support two-track audio conversion and Apple QuickTime may create two-track audio in the background without the user knowing it. Their response is that because none of the competing conversion SW does this conversion, then their SW is not defective. However, a brief note in their documentation would prevent inappropriate purchases.<br /><br />Their &#34;Try n Buy&#34; offer limits you to a 5 minute video. That would not have shown the problem on my video. They have ignored this in their messages back to me and are now offering a swap for another of their software titles.<br /><br />The problem with that &#34;solution&#34;??? They offer nothing that I am interested in!<br /><br />AGAIN, POOR SUPPORT, POOR DOCUMENTATION, POOR PRODUCT!	2015-06-08

For this reason, I tried to uninstall it, but it did not come with own uninstallation program. When I used Windows uninstallation program, it did not uninstall completely. I was instructed by their website that I had to download an additional uninstallation program and had to go to Windows Safe Mode. But when I restarted my Windows to get to the Safe Mode, Windows did not start even with safe mode.

I am a long time user of Quicken for windows, so naturally I'm comparing features and have found the Mac version somewhat lacking. Not being able to amortize loans is an unfavorable step backwards. I used to run several custom reports win the Win version, but reports don't seem to be available in Quicken for Mac. I liked the calendar view of upcoming bills to be paid, not available in Mac version. Importing downloaded transactions works well for the most part, but I have trouble getting Mac version to synchronize downloaded transactions with manually entered transactions, so I end up with double entries. Intuit needs to give the release of this version some thought and add functionality rather than release the software with the intent of upgrading down the road.	2015-06-08

It and bitdefender are usually competing neck-and-neck for the highest positions on Antivirus-Test websites (Like AV Test). But although Kaspersky Internet Security may be great at blocking viruses, it hasn't worked well for my computer. I purchased it less than an hour ago and, as soon as it's installed, my computer is slow and almost every web page is blocked and has to be added as an exception. The settings do not make it clear exactly what module does what, and even though I've now disabled almost everything except the file protection, my computer is still slow to load webpages. I'll keep using it for a few days to see if it gets any more bearable, but if not, it's going to be uninstalled. Unfortunately there is no way to get a refund for this product, so I don't have money to spend on a new antivirus if I decide to quit using this one. But honestly, if it keeps at this pace, for once NOTHING really will be better than SOMETHING.<br />p.s. my computer has an i7 and 32gb of RAM, there is no excuse for a program running in the background to be slowing it down like this.	2015-06-08

But this is not a good option if you need to file multiple states returns. While the initial software is priced very reasonably, it only comes with one state. They get you on subsequent stats which are charged at $39 a pieces plus tax. Additional fee for electronic filing is added on. So each additional state costs more than the federal&one state combined.<br />Also not good for filing amended returns. I recently purchased NY state to file the amended return and was unable to complete the task for two reasons.<br />1. The form required (IT-203-X) is not available<br />2. The software is stuck in electronic filing mode, which is indeed required by the NY state for the main filing but not for amended returns, which need to be filed by mail.	2015-06-08

Most of the features work exactly the same way, and I was able to export my Windows QB 2009 file to a Mac version of the file and import it with no problems.<br /><br />Note that QB 2015 for Mac does not do manual payroll. They want you to purchase their online payroll feature, but that is not cost effective if you only have a few employees. You will have to make all the split transactions yourself and know what accounts to use. However, you can duplicate checks and adjust the amounts in the split transactions, if necessary. Also, you will have to print your own pay stubs; I use Excel for that.<br /><br />Finally, it's not easy to adjust the format of the column headers in your invoices and checks. If you have printed invoices and checks, you will have some work to do. Their templates worked well enough for these, so it wasn't much of an issue for me.	2015-06-08

I have been a Quicken Windows customer for years and have never used all the features available.  I truly depend on the product to ensure that my accounts are updated, bills paid on time, and data is tracked for tax purposes.  No special investments are tracked, no business data, etc;  With that caveat, I had been running Quicken 2014 Professional under VM Parallels on my Mac.  It was the slowest, most exasperating experience so I read all the reviews and decided to buy the new 2015 Mac version.  The software runs fast and efficiently on the Mac now.  Account set up is quick and easy.  The downside is I never was able to convert my Quicken Win files.  Tried for two days and the converter software just kept stopping with an error.  I had done everything  Quicken support and community had suggested for converting VM Quicken files.......totally a waste of time.  Overall, if you can live with just exporting all your old data as archive and doing a new Quicken Mac install, AND are a basic user like I am, I think you will be pleased with this version.	2015-06-08

Now, I wish to start over but there are no online services to do this.  Get a a free online suite, save the headache and money.  Microsoft is no longer worth it!	2015-06-07

Being a Corel PaintShop Pro user, I expected Video Studio to be more than just the Corel version of Windows Movie maker.

I've been using Quicken now for over 15 years, and this release is an embarrassment to them. At its best, it is slow and crashes every few days. Nothing else on my PC ever crashes, just Quicken. I guess I'm trusting that even though they are incompetent at releasing a program that does not crash, they maybe are not corrupting all my data in the background.<br /><br />Recently they released a patch that wanted to be installed. I trusted that maybe they use or test their own software before pushing it to the public. I was rewarded by having the password changed to my data file and was then locked out, for good, game over. Luckily, trained by the daily program crashes, I backup EVERY TIME I use the software, cause you never know. The only solution was to reinstall Quicken to a prepatch version and restore the latest backup, prepatch. I truly feel sorry for those who don't backup every time they use it.<br /><br />Now, after two more patches, it no longer applies unknown passwords to the data file, and it's back to its regular crashing and new annoyances like dialog boxes that run off the screen so you can't enter transaction categories or split transactions without learning keyboard shortcuts. Apparently, keeping it usable is a low priority for them, with all the other self inflicted fires they have to put out that they randomly push out to unsuspecting users in untested patches.<br /><br />So, in conclusion, 1 star. If there was competition, I'd give it a try. Unfortunately, I don't know of any so hold your nose, cause this version sure stinks, and backup after every session.	2015-06-07

I've used an older version for years, but recently upgraded after purchasing my new Mac.  The 2015 version is an ENORMOUS improvement as far as banking is concerned.  Bank syncs are reliable, with just a few exceptions: 1. categories do not always autofill from previous entries (it just enters \\"undefined\\"); 2) occasionally, the sync does not recognize that I've already posted an entry (such as a debit receipt), so it duplicates the entry.  Anther item of frustration: When you enter a transfer from one account to another, the entry does not automatically offset in the other account - you have to post the transaction in both accounts.  The old version automatically entered the transaction in the corresponding account.  Bank reconciliations are a snap; this has saved me an incredible amount of time!	2015-06-06

The speed and response of the program does depend on your computer hardware so you need to pay attention to that aspect of the requirements.  It can be misleading because the program is relatively cheap.  But it is a CAD based software and provides loads of functions so your hardware capability cannot be neglected.<br />  I have however moved on to their professional product line “Chief Architect Premier”  for the following reasons:<br />1. Import 3D models from furniture, cabinet, etc manufactures (access to thousands of completed 3D objects)<br />2. Ray Trace rendering of your plans which takes into account lighting effects to produce photo realistic results.<br /><br />My move to their professional product is in no way a criticism of Home designer as Chief Architect Premier is $2,000+ more costly.  The marketers has split the product line in a very decent manner:<br /><br /> Home Design Interiors<br />  For those who want to get familiar with Computer Design Software and produce scaled interior designs quickly.  The problem is you are limited in choice of furniture’s  and cabinets etc.  It has 3D renderings but not ray trace photo realistic rendering (by the way ray trace rendering takes hours and hours to complete) which really needs high powered computing hardware.  They use the same menu’s in both the home and professional products so what you learn in the home product transfers if you decide to move up.  Features from their professional line are constantly being inserted into Home Design over time.<br /><br /> Chief Architect Premier<br /> The question is what can it not do?  I haven’t had a chance to explore all its possibilities but it is very meticulous in its design and capability and well thoughout to ensure ease of use where ever possible.  If you are a design professional, you need to evaluate this program.<br />  I had an occasion to call their support staff regarding some functions that were not clear to me and they were extremely helpful.  I do pay a yearly fee for support however I think it is well justified to save time.  Accessibility and questions  are addressed in a very timely and professional manner.  They have a rental program which I am using which allows me to get access to their support with minimal $ outlay and after 16 months I own the software.  It’s a great deal.  Once you own the software, your cost reduces down to annual support fee which includes any upgrades they come up with during the year of support.  Don’t have to pay for upgrades.<br />  The company was founded by a software programmer and his contractor friend about 20 years ago and their philosophy is provide the best practical Architectural /home design product possible.  Customer support, software design, sales are all in the same building in the US and there is constant feedback between departments.  They bend over backwards to please.  Both Home Desing and Chief Architect has loads of free online training videos, written instructions/articles and knowledge databases etc.<br />  Five stars on both products and also the company’s policies that make this all possible.is program.<br />  I had an occasion to call their support staff regarding some functions that were not clear to me and they were extremely helpful.

Both these programs are superior to Quicken for downloads of expense and stock transactions.  Even on Quicken I had to do my stock transactions manually.<br />I still have my Quicken 2011 for a stock ACB tracker (all of my previous data is there and I haven't found anything better). I tried Quicken 2014 and it was horrible (slow, lost all of my attachments on the conversion, cumbersome on .pdf attachments).  So I came to this site to see if Quicken 2015 was any better - since Mint is an Intuit product and many of their interfaces and reports on 2015 look similar. Apparently 2015 is not good as well.  So we'll check out 2016 if they can get the Mint team to bail them out!  For those of you interested - I like myFinance tracker since it shows holdings and correctly shows $US currency values - yet it would not connect to Questrade (one of my brokerage accounts) and Mint does.  The only negative with Mint so far (4 months usage) is that everything is reported in the same currency (the world revolves around the US).	2015-06-06

My wife has been a Quicken user for a long time.  The previous version she was using was Quicken 2012 Deluxe.  We needed to update, since the older version wouldn't connect to our online banking accounts for reconciliation. Since she wasn't using all of the budget planning pieces in the deluxe version we decided to go with the starter edition.  Upon installing the starter edition (which worked fine), I was asked if I wanted to import my existing file, I answered yes, only to be given the ERROR, &#34;Quicken Starter Edition is intended for new users only.  As such, it cannot open data files created with other version of Quicken.&#34;  Really???  There should be a way to import the elements needed.  Now I'm stuck either trying to get a refund or paying an additional $35 for the upgrade.	2015-06-06

I've used Quicken since 1994.  I had to uninstall and reinstall (Intuit's solution) to get rid of Quicken Deluxe 2015 R6, which was so buggy they pulled it from their servers.  I'm now running R8, and it still cannot even reliably handle its most basic function and reconcile an account statement.  I just tried to process a simple credit card statement--nine transactions and no balance carried forward.  When I reconciled the transactions, the un-reconciled total never went to zero and Quicken tried to enter two large adjustment transactions in the register.  When I closed the reconciliation window and looked at the account, 12 years of history was gone.  I closed Quicken and reopened the credit card account and my history was back.  The transactions I just tried to reconcile were marked as cleared but not reconciled. The second time around, Quicken let me finish the reconciliation. If there was a viable alternative to Quicken software, I would definitely move to it.  I have no faith in the information that Quicken 2015 shows me.	2015-06-05

I've been buying this Quicken and TurboTax every year since sometime around 1996.  I've got data from 1996 in my check register.  I've always steered others toward Intuit products.  Until now.  This is a company that has lost it's way and it shows in this product right here.  Sadly, I still use it because they're the only game in town.  I helped them create this monopoly.  Some of us should have kept MS Money in business.  If you buy this product it will auto-update itself to version 7.  Google &#34;Quicken 2015 v7 lockout&#34; and see what you get... I'm guessing a lot of angry comments.  The software locked up many folks' data files.  The corporate line... I sure hope you followed good policy and backed up so you can restore.  Look at the release notes for v8 - kind of sounds like they're blaming the customers for getting themselves locked out or misunderstanding.  You can't talk to anyone there when their software fails.  It's all online forums.  Then they arbitrarily shut down threads they don't like like an angry parent.<br /><br />This is not rocket science software, although I will confess they set the bar many years ago with the most intuitive user interface and ease of use.  That's what sold everyone.  Now they are just riding it as long as they can.  Someone smart should (will) come in and steal their golden goose because they've lost focus.<br /><br />From a frustrated user without a good option... I urge you to consider something else.  I'm in too deep.  But if someone wants to launch a competitive product please give me a shout.  I'd be glad to help.  And if someone from Intuit ever reads this (unlikely, why follow customers?) I'd be happy to consult with you.	2015-06-05

First with Microsoft money, then converting to quicken 2012.  Quicken 2012 worked great, no complaints.  Then I was forced to upgrade to 2015.  I work tech and understand improvements cost money, so while I don't like that model, it seemed worth re-upping my license...<br /><br />Then all h311 broke loose.  In the month since upgrading, my quicken database/file has become corrupted and unuseable twice!!  Fortunately I know what I'm doing and have solid backups on my PC, and restored my backup.  I have NEVER worked with such a crappy product upgrade as I have with this (and that is saying a lot given I deal with software vendors for a living).  I plan to limp thru the year and switch platforms at year end.  No more of this - I'd rather enter my trans manually and know things are correct than have everything crap out as often as it does.  If you're just getting started with this type of thing, look for something else.  Quality is non-existent in this release.	2015-06-05

But after noticing Quicken 2015 for Mac, I decided to try the Mac version.<br /><br />Transferring years of data from the PC to the Mac worked well. I just made sure to follow the directions meticulously.<br /><br />While the Mac version lacks many features of the Windows version, I was not using most of those features anyway. I miss a few things from the Windows version; but I actually prefer the interface on the Mac program. Plus, the convenience  of not having to reboot into the Windows partition allows me to check and update accounts far more frequently.	2015-06-05

I'm self employed and the Block product simply couldn't deal with the combination of self employed and using Obamacare.  When I called them, they said they had just received the final information they needed from the Feds in February and hadn't had time to adjust for the changes.  Their solution was to download some extremely complex tax forms from the IRS and figure it out myself.  Very frustrating and a total waste of my time and money.<br /><br />TurboTax, on the other hand, was complete and worked perfectly with this and all the other issues.  I got done very quickly (of course I had all my records and receipts together by then from the previous aborted filing attempt.<br /><br />The two products are fairly equal, though different, in their approach to asking questions and helping you work through the process.  It was easy to e-file my federal return, though I didn't want to pay the extra for the state e-file and simply printed and mailed that version.<br /><br />TurboTax is understandably getting raked over the coals for the changes they made in pulling some things out of their deluxe version and requiring an update to Premium.  I've used TurboTax in the past and this change was the thing that caused me to try HR Block.  TurboTax has gotten too expensive and this move to drive many of us to an even more expensive version is ugly.  But there is nothing else out there that works as well.  I'm going to bite the bullet and continue with TurboTax even in the face of their price policies (which are admittedly nasty).  I guess you get what you pay for.  The nice thing is that at least by buying at Amazon I got a good deal on the price.<br /><br />Overall, TurboTax seems to be a very good program and it's wonderful that they have enough professionals working on it to make the product complete, even in a very difficult situation.	2015-06-05

Contact tech support - where there is no phone number.  I sent an email, wonderful!!!!! The guy did not know what my problem was, gave me the run around, complained about this and very politely emailed back as to my reason for contacting Adobe. I had found his 'solution' already on the web site and we were back to the beginning. Finally found some instructions that sounded hopeful.

After installing, I experienced the problem of a script error with the error message saying it couldn't find a page on the internet. I solved this problem by editing the &#34;C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts&#34; file and inserting these two lines:<br /><br /># [Omnipage script block]<br /> 127.0.0.1 www.ocr.com<br /><br />I also read that there was a new installation file so I contacted Nuance customer support and in less than 10 minutes they had emailed me a link to get the new installation file. I then had to uninstall the software downloaded from Amazon, reboot the PC, and download and reinstall it.  After doing all this, the program seems to run quite well. It looks like a very sophisticated program. For simple OCR activities, it is quite easy to use. For more complex OCR activities, there is a learning curve. Overall, I would say it is an incredible value for the price of less than $30. I do think Amazon should have the version of &#34;Omnipage Standard 18&#34; that actually works available for download. I don't think one has to make the changes to the system file I mentioned above IF you have the latest version of &#34;Omnipage Standard 18&#34;. I might also add that there is a new release of this software but it is not even called &#34;Omnipage Standard 18&#34; and costs considerably more.	2015-06-04

Downloaded this last night due to an issue with Microsoft Streets & Trips (error 0xc004d301). There were a few people on forums suggesting this is a good replacement. It is not. Running street addresses is difficult and time consuming. If you want to search an intersection and drop a pin it takes quite a bit of effort and time. Additionally, there is no night mode for the map display, only high contrast. If you are used to running Streets & Trips as a search and pin system, this map system is far more complex and proves very frustrating. It has far more capabilities and settings, but is lacking in simplicity. Even when configured it does not allow for simple search and go settings. One thing I absolutely loved about it was the ability to use the GPS location to automatically search for things like gas stations and restaurants ahead of you within a specific degree.	2015-06-04

I know that it has saved me from malware intrusions many times because it pops up a dramatic warning when that happens.  On the other hand, about once every other week, when I come into my office in the morning, SecureAnywhere tells me that something called the &#34;Morto Trojan&#34; has appeared on my hard drive.  SecureAnywhere seems to clean up that infection without letting it do any damage, but nevertheless, it allows the same malware to reappear again and again.  The more serious deficiency of SecureAnywhere is, however, its automatic cloud backup feature.  To begin with, setting up a backup schedule is infuriatingly counter-intuitive.  Then it's very hard to determine if the backups are working as intended.  (For example, in Internet Explorer, SecureAnywhere's yellow dot on a file name can mean &#34;This file is not yet backed up,&#34; but it can also mean &#34;This file is backed up identically from more than one folder.&#34;  When my hard disk crashed, and I went to restore my files from the cloud, I found that SecureAnywhere had stopped making backups of my Outlook folders several months earlier, and I had lost everything from the intervening weeks.  I'm motivated to write this review today because I just checked the backups of my Outlook folders to ensure that they're okay, and I found that SecureAnywhere has again cancelled my daily scheduled backup without notifying me.  I'm going to have to look at other security packages.  ADDENDUM:  As soon as Amazon published this review of SecureAnywhere, the manufacturer commented on it and invited me to contact Webroot support for help in resolving my problems.  The support team did respond promptly, and they did resolve my immediate problem.  After that, however, I asked how I can ensure that SecureAnywhere doesn't turn off my backups again without notifying me.  In response, the Webrootsupport team told me how to check the activity log to determine if SecureAnywhere is in fact working.  They summarized their recommendations as follows:  &#34;Each back up [sic] software has different strengths and weaknesses, and most require the user interaction [sic] to ensure that they are working correctly.&#34;  I'll let that reply speak for itself.  ADDENDUM 2:  A year later, I still have to check SecureAnywhere every morning to see if it has backed up my new files overnight.  It's not at all unusual for me to find that it has NOT.  Whenever I see that my new files are unprotected, the &#34;Backup & Sync&#34; tab of the SecureAnywhere control panel  shows that Backup and Sync are both inexplicably turned OFF.  Rebooting the computer seems to resolve the problem — until it happens again, usually within about a week.  The anti-malware features of SecureAnywhere have been effective, but this HUGE flaw in the backup feature is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.  ADDENDUM 3:  I give up.  Every morning, SecureAnywhere reports that it ran my backups as scheduled during the night, but when I look at the backup copies that are available for restoration from the cloud, they're often two weeks out of date.  A support person instructed me to uninstall and reinstall SecureAnywhere, which did get the backups working again for a few days until everything returned to what is apparently NORMAL —  confident but completely false assurances.  On my most recent call, the support person told me that SecureAnywhere is an anti-virus package, not a backup package, and I would probably be happier with dedicated backup software.  I thanked him for an honest answer.	2015-06-04

Fortunately, the main file had been automatically backed up a few days before, so I made a copy of the backup file and I am now using that file as my main file. A few days ago, there was a message that an update was available that fixed: &#34;Some customers getting an unexpected/incorrect password prompt preventing them from accessing their data file in R6/R7 version(s).&#34; I've been unable to update. All in all a very frustrating experience but I need the program to keep track of my investments and my rental expenses. So I am stuck.	2015-06-04

I see that reviews for this program fall into two categories: (1) Wow, so this is how screenplays are supposed to look!  This program automatically formats them.  Awesome!  I can write screenplays now and make movies! (2) I have to use this program for a living and this program is no more glamorous to me than a plow is to a farmer.  I fall into the latter category.  (Although I envy beginners their enthusiasm for formatting and begrudge them none of their excitement at entering the world of screenwriting -- that phase doesn't last more than a few months.)  If you're a professional screenwriter, especially for TV, then you pretty much have to use this program until someone comes out with something better that fulfills all the professional requirements needed by TV and film production companies.  Sad, but true.  Sad because, since this is a business of art, it would be nice to have a really elegant program upon which to ply said art.  But FD gets the job done.  Final Draft support has been spotty over the last twenty years I've been using it. Sometimes good, frequently not.  They are quite a small company, and management has not always been... &#34;people-oriented,&#34; shall we say?  Many a show (I work mostly in TV) has suffered through innumerable glitches and crashes over the years, and there are still -- even at version 9 -- some oddly persistent problems: -- nonstandard Mac interface (for example, pressing the Command and the , keys simultaneously should select Preferences like every other Mac program. It does not.) -- still has many pagination bugs. -- still has display issues that corrupt the display of the script occasionally. -- nonintuitive interface that feels rather Windows 95 instead of Mac OS X. -- bugs in the Revision Mode presets. -- inability to set certain defaults in a new script, such as making Character Name follow Dialogue automatically.  Instead, you must reset this every time you makea new script.  For some reason, the programmers think an action line follows every piece of dialogue in every script. -- company resources spent making useless features like speaking your script out loud and using index cards instead of fixing bugs. -- thesaurus is still barebones. Not a big deal since, you know, the internet. -- spellcheck is sloooooow. If you type moderately fast, it won't flag misspells till you're a sentence or two past it. -- the &#34;feature&#34; called CollaboWriter that supposedly lets you collaborate online with a distant partner was nonfunctional, so they removed it.  It has never worked in the real world.  (BTW, it doesn't work on Movie Magic Screenwriter, either.  Do a google search and you will find that not one single reviewer or user has ever managed to get this &#34;feature&#34; to work.)   A colleague just showed me how to collaborate over the internet: use Skype!  Do a video call, and then check the little box that says &#34;share screen,&#34; and your partner can see your entire screen as you type!  This is awesome and works very well. So not having Collabowriter is no biggie. -- it be nice to have a default zoom level and window positioning on the screen, so that scripts don't open up all over the place and at different sizes.  Here are features that are either useless or annoying to professionals: -- text-to-speech, speaking your script out loud. (This is a pretty risible feature.) -- writing management and statistics. -- watermark your script.  This one is laughable.  The sure sign of an amateur is the fear that someone will steal their script (sorry!). Also, don't put your WGA registration number or copyright number on your script. Another sign of an amateur. -- full screen mode.  Seriously?  I know it sounds like I’m being harsh, but they could’ve used the resources/time spent making the above useless features to FIX BUGS.  Sorry for the shouting ;)  New features that professionals will probably never use: -- script notes enhancements. Script notes are a pain. You have to click on that stupid little box. Only one writer I know uses them, and we won't read them in her scripts if she does. But whatever works for you... -- character highlighting. At tables reads, the scripts are printed out as hard copy, so the colors are a bad idea. Some actors highlight, some don't.  Neutral features: -- revision colors.  Haven't used that, so I don't know if it's useful. -- scene navigator and character navigator. I think they add nothing, but I could see how someone might find them useful.  Great new features: -- replace character names globally.  I know, only one great new feature. Not promising.  They are a small company, and they don't sell millions of copies of this software, so I think they make the bulk of their money by selling upgrades to new versions.  They're not making enough to have a big customer service department, and the quality of that service has gone up and down over the years. At least now someone from the company is replying to Amazon review complaints.  The number of professional screenwriters numbers in the thousands, perhaps tens of thousands at best. So they need amateurs and the curious to buy FD to stay in business. Amateurs and the curious can turn into professionals, so this is a good thing, IMO. So I forgive them their pandering to that market.  We were all beginners once.  I pointed out a few bugs in a previous version (6x), on the phone with the head of the company, and he told me (and I quote): &#34;Yeah, we're not fixing those.&#34; True to his word, it's 3 versions later, and he has not fixed them.  He didn't even have the decency to lie to me and say he'd address in in a future incremental upgrade!  You know, in Hollywood, when you don't care enough to lie -- that's bad news.  He also made on odd confession to me. He said &#34;You know, we don't sell nearly as many copies of this as people think we do.&#34;  Hmmm...that explains a lot. He was on a podcast recently and he kept talking about the &#34;40 people at his company who work hard every day to make this program great.&#34;  40 people?!?!  Holy dog doo. That's a lot of people ignoring bugs! I wouldn't brag about that, man.  Anyway, version 8 and 9 for Mac works pretty well these days and I've had none of the fatal crashes and bugs of yesteryear.  And you also can't blame us writers for holding residual grudges for all the times we've gotten burned in the past by this program.  Writing is damned difficult, and when the actual software gets in the way, it's a ready target for our frustrations that may be stemming from the writing process itself.  Anyway, if you're a professional, you have to use this if you're in the studio/network TV system and you already know it. No matter what any review says.  (Unless you don't need compatibility with a production company). If you're not a professional yet, but you really want to be someday, you may as well learn its quirks now.  That way you can suffer along with the rest of us.  Bottom line: it works.  It ain't elegant, but it works and it's solid these days -- I haven't had a crash in several years.  (I've had pagination bugs and corrupted scripts but no crashes.  Which reminds me -- SAVE your script after every few lines.  Command-S on the Mac.  I do it like breathing now because otherwise sadness will occur when files are damaged.  Which is rare -- but it happens.)  When they update the interface and address current bugs, I'll upgrade my review to 5 stars.  But for now, they get 3.  They lose stars for 18 years of frustration and failing to address current bugs.  But they gain some for finally being stable, otherwise I'd give them a one.  The pagination, spellcheck, and revision mode bugs are the most annoying and persistent. These are the ones that annoy every writer every day. If they fixed these, it would go a long way towards making happy users instead of begrudging users.  Footnote: I'm writing this review as a professional screenwriter, for better or worse.  For those just starting or contemplating starting a writing career, software is the least of your concerns.  Don't obsess about it.  No software in the world is going to make you a writer.  No book is going to make you a writer.  No stupid course/seminar/retreat is going to make you a writer. Go get celtx, a free screenwriting program and see how you like this writing thing.  If you love writing and like your work, then go buy FD.  It's a decent enough plow.  Here's the best screenwriting advice I can give you: find your own voice. Don't try to fit in. Be original. You'll feel better and get hired more and be rewarded by the industry.  (Unless you want to be a TV hack and turn out CSI episodes, then please suppress any originality.  On the upside, the check from CSI will always clear and you'll have a very nice car.)  Happy writing.	2015-06-04

I don't know why but my computer seems to operate smoothly and more quickly once it was installed and the McAfee Total Protection software I had before was deleted.  This surprised me, but also the professionalism that the Avast company demonstrates in the web appearance and accessibility of its software product.  This software has already blocked a virus or two since I've owned it, and it is easy to open up, and once it does, it has several features you can investigate.  My advice to those who are curious are to go ahead and try it, and use it for 30 days.  You might find out it works well for you too.  Certain speed bumps to look out for are 1/Avast popups that tell you there is no firewall.  With my Windows 7 Home version, I have a Firewall installed with it, so I don't need one.  You should check to make sure you have a Firewall protection already for yours if you get Avast.  If not, Avast will sell you one for $19.00.	2015-06-03

It makes the most common views harder to access, and goes to generally less contrast in presentation so you have to look harder for the buttons you need.  Its almost like Intuit is looking for changes to make to they can force you to purchase the newer version, via threat of discontinuing payroll service.

I had 360 and realized that I did not need some of the bells and whistle that came with it but I was very please with the security it gave me as it blocked a lot of junk trying to get in and many attacks which it notified me each time an intrusion was blocked.  What I do not like is Norton keeps trying to get me to install their ToolBar and after repeated Nos and Donot Ask Me Again it still continues.  But I guess other Internet programs have their own crap they are trying to get you to download.  Their ratings were very good with PC Mag and a couple other testing labs that I reviewed.

It has been cumbersome from the start.  It is difficult to reconcile and needs to have separate debit and credit cards.  I have updated the program every time an update comes along hoping it would address these two problems but it never has.  And now, I was entering two entries into the register and it locked up and I could not enter or delete the entry.  I called for help and after a considerable amount of time on the phone he told me I would need to purchase a 3 year service program for $299.  I told his I had used the older version of the program on my Mac for years and had never had a single problem and I was not going to pay that for them to help me.  He then told me I could pay $149 for a one time service help, I again said no; then he told me they would give me a bargain for $110; that is still considerably more that I paid for the program itself.  I am going to go with a different banking program altogether.	2015-06-03

There are volume/gain (decibel) slides for each individual audio track and the  master volume and all have a left-right balance. 2)<br />2) Why do so many reviews say they have trouble downloading? Downloaded and ran on the first try. I’ve used this program for about 20 hours over the last two weeks and I have not had a single problem.<br />3) Why don’t people read about what they are being and know what they are paying for? You won’t get a Maserati if you’re paying the price of a Ford (not knocking Ford). This is not a several hundred (or thousand) dollar video editing software suite – this is a low cost/low budget video editing software package that does exactly what is says it will do –nothing more and nothing less.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the reviewers – at first, Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum wasn’t very intuitive to me, but the more I have used it, I have learned the “intuitiveness” of the software. The couple times I used the Help feature, it really was helpful. I had used very basic software before with the capability for one video and up to 2 audio tracks. Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum has numerous editing options to help create a top quality video – but remember, you will likely not make a feature film production with this, but for family, and YouTube, etc. this is software is more than adequate. Bottom line – for a very reasonable price you get a reasonable product with Sony Movie Studio 13 Platinum.	2015-06-03

Looking at my console log revealed that it was writing a bunch of garbage. This is a known issue, apparently for the Trend product. But, this isn't a Trend review--it's merely a comparison.<br /><br />Norton's product works well for me on both Macs and Windows. I do not like Norton's portal, however, as they make it nearly impossible to activate two sets of licenses. Not a game changer, but it's a bit of a nuisance.	2015-06-03

I purchased it here on Amazon and received the following error: This product is not intended for your identified region, please contact customer support. I paid for it and received no information that I would not be able to activate the product. I then spent over 30 minutes on hold waiting for Microsoft support to pickup. Once the guy picked up, he asked me for the product key (took about 15 minutes to get it across to him since he was not a native English speaker and he could not understand me) and then he told me he could not help me, but if I wanted to buy MS Office again I could go to Microsoftstore.com to purchase it. Thanks Microsoft!	2015-06-02

HUGE FAIL	Well, this is pretty horrid. I got a new computer and thought I'd get the new version of Word. I told the salesperson I wanted to work completely offline and said this would do it. Well that was a lie. I can not figure out how to use without signing in with a MICROSOFT password (seriously???) and then being told all documents would be stored in the cloud. Well, that is seriously NOT what I want. I have tried and tried but nothing seems to work to just open it and use Word. This is seriously disappointing and if I can't figure it out in 5 days, I'm going to uninstall it, ask for my money back and install the old Word and work very hard to make sure I use as few Microsoft products as possible in the future.	2015-06-02

I have been using Quicken for over 20 years, and generally like it. I recently upgraded, and this version is HORRIBLE. I used to be able to input transactions very quickly and easily. They have made it laborious and buggy.<br /><br />When I installed the upgrade, it a) combined two entirely separate accounts, my personal financial account and the financial records for a small business I am keeping books for, into one account. This is disastrous---we are COMPLETELY separate entities and our financial records should NOT be comingled. b) For some reason, when I open Quicken now, it shows 3 versions of most of my accounts. I had to delete the superfluous ones by hand. And, it won't let me make adjustments on some accounts.<br /><br />The new Quicken is AWFUL. If I could, I would uninstall it, toss it in the trash, and go back to my old version. Unfortunately, my new computer requires the upgraded version. This is so bad that after 20+ years, I may be switching financial record keeping programs altogether.	2015-06-02

This latest release doesn't bring much to the party and in fact, made some changes that are a bit irritating. I wish the engineers had remembered the old saying, \\"Don't fix what isn't broken.\\" So here are my thoughts:<br />*  When performing a 'One Step Update' with my bank account, Q2015 renders a blank screen. My previous version populated the screen with my different accounts and showed the update progress for each - I liked that better.<br />*  When I put the cursor in the Payee field and press Ctrl+D, the list of payees appears instead of deleting the transaction. My previous version worked properly.<br />*  When entering a new transaction, the auto -populate feature under Payee appears and totally blocks out the Payee field so I can't see what I'm typing. This never happened before.<br />*  The Budgeting feature has gotten so cumbersome, I don't use it anymore. I now do all my budgeting in the check register with 'Bill and Income Reminders' that are \\"auto entered\\" a month in advance.<br />*  Under \\"Reports - Easy Answers - How Much Did I Pay To\\", when I put in a name, the report always comes back empty with the message, \\"Quicken cannot find any transactions ...\\", even though there are plenty of Payees in the check register with that name.<br /><br />With all that said, I still depend on Quicken completely and also use QuickBooks for my business.	2015-06-02

Quicken was a difficult transition but I made it. After years of bugs and constant troubles, I continued to think that it would get better over time and just wait for the next version or update. Sometimes it worked fine even though the categorization learning mechanism is very outdated. This version worked reasonably well until the last update.<br /><br />I use online/one-step updates from my financial institutions to load current data into Quicken regularly. I have it scheduled to keep things updated regularly so that I can review them on a monthly basis.<br /><br />I have multiple personal accounts of various types and two small business accounts in the system which are separated by the Tag feature. This is a pretty limited implementation and they could have done a much better job with it. This is best used with single small businesses but they do claim to support more than one. I can tell you it is clunky.<br /><br />When the online sync/download from financial institutions works, it works reasonably well. However, Quicken arbitrarily drops online download support from each version of Quicken every couple of years to force you to purchase a new version. My recommendation to my mother to purchase this software years ago has cost her hundreds of dollars to keep up with the simple feature of online updates because of this fact. Also note, if you use Mint, do not expect Quicken to have the same financial institutions. For some reason Quicken is FAR more limited than Mint.com is even though they are supposed to be the same company.<br /><br />Downloaded transactions are categorized based on a semi-decent logic based on previous categorizations I made in the past. Transfers among accounts are finally recorded properly most of the time now after years of trouble with that throughout the previous versions.<br /><br />Mobile/online sync was supposed to be a big new feature, but itis merely a cheap balance visibility tool. My banks and credit cards have more advanced mobile software components than Quicken does. The online sync portion looks identical to Mint and offers far fewer features than Mint does.<br /><br />The latest update corrupted my entire data file by somehow destroying my local file password and my synced data as well. According to Quicken, the only option is to restore from backup.<br /><br />Mistakes happen, it is true. I am a software developer and consultant and have made them myself. However, that is what QA teams are for and beta testers etc. After this many years of using this product and seeing issues with each release--it is no longer a mistake in a random software release.<br /><br />This is a pattern of poor quality and terrible support from Quicken that I have personal knowledge of over at least the past five years or so. This particular failure has been the last straw for me. I have lost months of data and categorization work. Yes I should have backed up every week and I usually do, but life happens. I actually thought that the auto backup would run like the scheduled updates do. It does not.<br /><br />Please consider my experience with multiple versions of this product as background and a demonstration of my previous hope and investment in the product.<br /><br />Even if you try it and have no issues for a little while, you cannot trust that it will last.<br /><br />As a developer and long-term customer of Quicken, I am finished--do not take a chance because it is a big name company and one of the few commercial options today. It is not worth it and it will not get any better. It has not over the past five years.	2015-06-02

The subscription can be extremely problematic for travelers.<br /><br />- If you are contractually obligated to safeguard the privacy of client data, ask some hard questions about how Microsoft Cloud stands up to real Security Guidance and checklists.  Marketing and convenience is still way ahead of actual security. Clouds are data centers run by real people (who just happen to have direct access to your data).  Cases where thousands of credit card numbers or thousands of tax returns are compromised most likely originate behind the firewall of a data center.  Someone with access issues a query or grabs a file and this data walks out the front door on a USB stick or is lifted over a VPN connection.  I actually had a Cloud vender tell me &#34;control is not security&#34;.  I can guarantee you that an absence of control doesn't exactly answer any of the items on a hard security checklist or STIGs.<br /><br />- No clear road map for Office.  This matters.  There is still a need for an Office Suite that does not put you in danger of a reduced functionality mode during extended stays at client sites where Internet is not available (YES - SUCH PLACES EXIST). No answer to the basic question of having a version of Office that is fully functional at all times in the absence of an Internet connection has us looking hard at alternatives to Microsoft Office.<br /><br />- Customer service and activation is absolutely &#34;IRS Call Center&#34; hellish.  Service is not there.	2015-06-02

Here's the thing though: there is no possible way of doing so either through the program itself or on your account profile on their website. I ended up going through some unnecessary troubles to do so. I'm not going to go into it, but thankfully the only way I've found to extend a subscription was through a link another reviewer had posted:  http://home.mcafee.com/root/ECards.aspx?affid=0&pkgid=274,275&cid=83215&culture=en-US  I hope this review helps some people from avoiding a headache.

Two nights ago I downloaded/bought it. Next morning I do the updates since software released. Forgot how many, but they were numerous. 2015 must have come on the market less than half-baked. Was on support hold for more than 45 minutes without talking to anyone. Finally, yesterday evening, I used chat. That was around an hour of time. When we ended, I could open it. I didn't try doing any updating of accounts or anything else because I had had it with Q 15. This morning, I started to do my account updates. After I clicked on updates it wanted a quicken ID although in preferences I marked no passwords. Quicken ID won't recognize my password; so I go through the Forgot Password exercise in futility about 4 times. Each time I change, each time it doesn't recognize it. So, I close down, I restart, and guess what? I cannot even open a quicken file until I log in with my Quicken ID, which is a phantom.  If I until I'm presuming I have to reinstall 14 since they removed it during the 15 installation process.

It was good to get things back in order.  Intuit is trying to balance the graphical expectations of users with performance and has yet to strike an optimal balance.  In fairness, my desktop PC is a bit on the old side, but it is not wimpy.  Sometimes Quicken can take 10-20 seconds just to save a transaction as it updates all the related accounts and windows on the screen.  However, it works for me.  I like how Intuit has done integrations with some financial institutions.  With my credit union, for example, I can initiate a transfer from within Quicken and execute it automatically without having to go to the website.

After several months of usage, I was locked out of my data after the latest patch (R6 and R7) forever encrypted my data file. When I contacted support, I was told there is no way to get it back, and my only option is to restore from my backup. Well, my backup was a month old, and it did not include the latest bills I added, and all of the ones I already paid came up as &#34;past due&#34;. I had to go back and go through all my bank transactions manually to check which ones I paid and which ones I did'nt. There's got to be a better product out there that doesn't release a buggy patches. There are lots of people that were affected by this buggy release. Just check out online all the frustration that people posted regarding the R6, R7 updates. I don't recommend this product.	2015-06-02

I only updated because of the messages and warning emails that the previous version would no longer connect to my Credit Union.  Well the 2015 version doesn't connect either, so I wasted money on an update that doesn't work.  The new interface is horrible.  Navigating from accounts or reports is un-intuitive and all of the items have moved from where they were in the old version.  When updating, none of the budgets or account connections move to the new update.

While doing my taxes, close to the deadline, Turbo Tax Personal told me I needed Turbo Tax Personal and Small Business to complete my taxes. I could not locate a disc form of Turbo Tax Personal and Business locally so I purchased and downloaded it from Amazon in April. It was supposed to transfer my existing information from Turbo Tax Personal to Turbo Tax Personal and Business but I ended up with a letter from my state revenue office asking about entries I had submitted.<br /> I triple check all form entries before I print my forms for myself and 'snail-mail' my forms to the state and federal because honestly, I do not trust E-file, at all. The only think I can figure out is Turbo Tax Personal and Small Business did not load the information from Turbo Tax Personal correctly. It's all been very frustrating with Turbo Tax this year. I'm really wondering if I'll purchase it again or go with another provider. I'll decide that later.	2015-06-02

After reading a lot of the reviews, I was very hesitant to purchase this, but I needed it to sync with my accounts online so I took the plunge. So far it's been very stable, only had one crash (and that was probably due to me not being patient after I entered a transaction and tried clicking somewhere else). A little slow, but nothing I can't live with. Even with the one crash, it still remembered all my transactions I had just entered, including the one it crashed on, so I didn't have to re-enter anything.<br /><br />I was afraid it would not sync correctly with my accounts (again, after reading all the bad reviews), but it synced up perfectly with them and has been running smoothly (3 credit card accounts, and I added a loan account very painlessly). It won't sync with my bank for personal banking, but that's my bank's issue, not Quicken (small local credit union, chooses not to support Quicken). Backups work fine, account syncs work fine, couldn't be happier other than the slight lag (that and the one crash is why it's 4 star and not 5). Now I'm afraid that since I've posted my positive review that I'll start running into issues right and left, but I guess if I do I'll just update the review.	2015-06-01

I highly recommend this software for any artist wanting to create digital artwork. I am a traditional artist who has dabbled with several digital art programs, but have always found them to be either (1)complicated and time consuming, or (2)limited in function.  SketchBook Pro solves both of these problems through its design. It seems easier to learn, and can be as simple or complex as you need it to be. The pens, pencils, and brushes provide the natural feel that I have been looking for in an art program. While other art software has caused feelings of frustration and disappointment; SketchBook Pro allows me to experience the joy and creativity like that of traditional drawing and painting.<br />  My only reason for giving it a 4 star rather than a 5 star review is for the fact that it didn't download correctly from Amazon. However, when I went to the Sketchbook Pro website and downloaded it there using the serial # provided through my Amazon purchase it downloaded perfectly.	2015-06-01

So far it's been a very mixed bag. I hate the way the reconcile function works - it autoselects items but makes a direct comparison with my statement more difficult. It doesn't show in the register the items already reconciled (from the past reconciliation). Functions are harder to find. What was once an easy task - linking accounts so that transfers or credit card payments were handled quickly - now requires more clicks, etc. Can't say much about the interface either. On the positive side, downloading account information seems much easier (even though I don't like how it auto-assigns categories). I haven't put it through all of its paces but I can't say I'm thrilled with this version.	2015-06-01

It's not like it would cost them more by letting you continue. It would be different if the upgrades offered a significant value, but for what I need the first version that I bought many yeas ago would still be sufficient for me. A lot of that is because they have no real competition like they did when Microsoft Money was around.

That is, consistent in undershooting the mark. Why, why, why, for example, does Intuit insist on forcing the Brokerage structure on users. The problem with the Brokerage structure is that every active investment from a particular institution is conflated into a single account. These account entries are hard enough to read as it is. It's the equivalent of giving the user data reports only after the reports have been processed through a shredder and then through a shake-and-bake baggie.<br /><br />Another downside to this choice is that if you have several accounts at one institution, you can only download into one of those accounts. Then, of course, you have to go through and delete data from all the other accounts to clean up the one account, AND THEN you have the pleasurable task of manually keying in the data for all the other accounts.<br /><br />And what's the deal with &#34;Market Value&#34;? Seems it should be a fairly straight-forward math problem: # of shares x current market price. That formula works only if you don't make &#34;Dividend Income&#34; entries with your &#34;Reinvest Dividend&#34; entries. How is a user supposed to make use of the &#34;Dividend Income&#34; report if there is no dividend income entered?<br /><br />And, same as previous incarnations, the support for Quicken for Mac is close to abysmal AGAIN. The whole point of the Mac system is to make the user experience as intuitive as possible. Trying to figure how to make effective use of the Investments component of Quicken is brutal, time-consuming, and most definitely NOT intuitive.<br /><br />On the bright side, including the Investments module in Quicken 2015 for Mac fixes the most glaring inadequacy of Quicken Essentials. It seems to me that Intuit just does not really want to support the Mac product. They'd much rather devote their energies to reaping huge profits from making loans. I can see how they might think that anyone who can effectively manage money, using their software or not, would be least likely to become a debtor. If they're not willing to love this ugly (in their minds) stepchild, then give the child up for adoption. Perhaps, Apple would be a good home for this sadly neglected child.	2015-05-31

What I mean by that, is that if your video isn't super simple, it will crash. Regularly. Especially if you're using the feature to edit audio in AudioDirector and then switch back, there's about a 50% chance it'll crash trying to import the new file back in. And then after you have to close it, it won't even reopen!  Also, it will regularly not line clips up properly, even if the black line saying they're aligned shows up. They'll be one frame off and it's infuriating.  I've been dealing with this for awhile but I'm considering buying a new program.	2015-05-31

Nothing about this chronically broken, poorly designed software is worthy of your time or money.  Intuit lost its mojo a long time ago, and it looks like it will not be coming back.  Mac users have always been the red-headed step-children of the Microsoft obsessed Intuit programmers, and this latest slap in the face is just further proof.  Downloads don't work properly, reports cannot be customized with any detail, transactions are a jumbled mess after downloading, many hang-ups when trying to use, shuts down for no apparent reason, lacking many features of Windows version - the list goes on.  I kept the software thinking that Intuit would surely fix the problems, but they persist and their patches are a joke.  I would ask for a refund, but I am past my 60 day window.  I am baffled as to why there is not one decent piece of software for financial tracking for Mac users.	2015-05-31

Until this year, I have endorsed their Quicken product. Quicken has been doing a series of patches in late April through today. Their R5 & R6 patches didn't block access to my data file as it did to so many others. Last week they announced that an R8 patch was available for download that would insure that you wouldn't have any future issues in gaining access to your data files. Even though I didn't have file access problems up to this point, like a fool I took the bait and download the R8 patch yesterday (5/30) and instead of protecting me from future data access issues, it now asks for a password to get access to my data file that I never set up, so Quicken has now blocked my access to my data. The irony of all of this is that they claim that these patches were to improve security for mobile app users.  Well they have accomplished that goal. No hacker can access my data including me. Tried to use chat support yesterday together get help fixing this,  but chat was also broken likely due to overload. Before you buy this product do yourself a big favor and do a web search for Quicken 2015 patch R6, R7, R8.  This is all from the same company that gutted major parts of their TurboTax 2014 Deluxe product and forced users to buy their most expensive version (they did end up doing a refund). Once I get to a support person, I know that it will involve hours of investment on my part to get back to current data. If I'm lucky that process can start today.	2015-05-31

Although a long-time McAfee user, I have been on the fence about McAfee for some time.  The only reason I renewed last time, at a ridiculous price, was because I have a 3 PC license that is shared with family members' laptops.  It was the path of least resistance to just renew rather than find new software and hassle with installing it on three devices in three different locations.  This time I purchased Total Protection2015  for 3 PCs at a great price and tried to install it today.  I tried to enter the product code too many times to count on different devices, different browsers, etc. etc.  I just kept getting a message that said my product code was not entered correctly.<br /><br />I finally bit the bullet and called McAfee's extremely unpleasant off-shore tech support.  I have no issue with off-shore call centers if the person I speak to is understandable and can understand me.  This was not the case. This was the best part of the call. They were completely unhelpful, rude and offensive.<br /><br />I now have software I cannot install, but that's OK.  I wouldn't use McAfee under any circumstances at this point.<br /><br />Thank you McAfee.  You made my decision for me.  I will take my business elsewhere and will not be back.	2015-05-31

Given Quicken 2012 Deluxe worked just fine for me, I was reluctant to upgrade, but did because April 2015 deadline was looming.<br /><br />Well, the 2015 version of Quicken has been nothing but trouble.  I have a few accounts I have to reset or deactivate/reactivate almost every time I update my transactions.  They just stop downloading even though Quicken message says all downloaded as of &#34;&#60;insert present day here&#62;&#34;.  Then when I reset the account or deactivate/reactivate, all transactions that I already downloaded from the prior few months are duplicated so I have to go in and then manually delete the duplicated ones.  Needless to say this is extremely error-prone and 2-3 times now I have had to compare my banks website to Quicken to make a reconciliation (for example if I deleted the wrong transaction and now account is unbalanced).<br /><br />I talked to Quicken support through their Chat interface and eventually the tech support person had me turn off automatic downloads to the register and we were hoping that fixed it.  Unfortunately no and today I came in and my accounts wouldn't update until I deactivated/reactivated.  I'm busy deleting transactions duplicated now. :(  I was hoping that this problem would be quickly rectified by Quicken, but it's hanging on now since I bought the SW in ~ Jan/Feb timeframe.  Honestly I am spending a lot of time to analyzing problems with Quicken and not much time looking at my finances.  I wish there was some alternative to Quicken.  All I really want to do is download my transactions to track my spending and map to budgets.  I want it to be relatively easy process (not 20 minutes overhead each time I use the program).	2015-05-31

With the short exposure to the product, it may be too soon.  However; based on the product review by independent sources, the reports of other users known to me and the my own brief exposure, I will concur that the value is one of the better anti-virus tools.<br /><br />A word of caution if you are either computer semi-literate, an elder past 70 or both.  I successfully got past \\"install\\" but ran into difficulty in the \\"activation\\" stage.  I initially worked with a Kaspersky on-line support but ran out of time.  The next day I opted for the verbal support on the theory that I could \\"activate\\" the software quicker with verbal guidance.  I was connected with an Asian operation (Philippines?) \\"iyogi\\".  I eventually agreed to a PC cleansing operation with a five year term ($370+ cost) in addition to a reinstalled and activated Kaspersky Anti-Virus.  I suppose that I'm suffering from buyer's remorse (my personal problem) and it may still turn out to be advantageous to someone with my level of skills.  My main complaint is that what was installed by \\"iyogi\\" was limited to 1 user (whereas I purchased the 3 user version).  When I questioned it, the response was, other users in my household would have to contact \\"iyogi\\".  In effect \\"iyogi\\" inserted themselves between the seller and the buyer and changed the terms of the initial purchase action to their own hoped for advantage (possible future cleansing sales).  In my book, not completely ethical - avoid \\"iyogi\\".	2015-05-31

I enjoyed the ease of use and never had an issue. HOWEVER...last year (2013 tax year) I used it for taxes, just like normal. I took money out of my retirement fund when moving from a job, and entered it in when TT asked me. Everything looked good, submitted the return and got a check a few weeks later. In December 2014 I got a letter from Maine Revenue Services. Scared, I opened the letter to see that I had been audited, and my return had a mathematical error! I thought &#34;no way, I used TT and it always has all types of advertisement that math errors are double checked..ect..&#34; I pulled the 1040 from my cabinet and sure enough, the program MADE A MATH ERROR, to the tune of $900ish. I thought I must be doing something wrong so I took my return to HR Block and they went through it. Yes, TT had made a math error. The program skipped over line 19 (or whatever line it was) and did not add it to the total for taxable income. ARGH. Maine gave me 30 days to pay out the error, with interest and penalties. I had to cough up $572 on the spot...due to a math error from Turbo Tax.<br /><br />HERE IS THE WORST PART - and the reason I felt compelled to write the review. I contacted Intuit and asked for help before I paid the IRS. They did not respond. I waited until the deadline for payment and ended up paying the IRS to prevent further issues. I re-contacted Intuit and sent me an email a month later saying &#34;Dear Mr. xxxxx,<br />We do apologize for the delay in processing your claim.  We are moving as quickly as possible to process all claims but are a little behind.  We cannot provide a specific date by which your determination will be made but we will complete our analysis and provide your resolution just as soon as we can.&#34; Wow, thanks. This was January 31. Sent a third email...STILL NO RESPONSE.<br /><br />NEVER again will I use this program. I went to TaxAct online and did it for free. NO ISSUES. NO $$$. So much for the &#34;accuracy guarantee&#34;	2015-05-31

Previous versions have been extremely buggy, but 2015 hasn't been too bad.  However, over the last 2 weeks they released versions 6 and 7.  One of these versions caused many users to be unable to open their data files.  The file is essentially locked and unable to be used.  Extremely frustrating for someone like me who has many years of data accumulated.  On 5/27/2015 Quicken released version 8, which supposedly fixes the problem.  However, for users who were already affected by the issue, there is no remediation.  According to Quicken, &#34;This patch cannot unlock files that are already locked. This could not be resolved with product update without adversely impacting the data quality any further.&#34;  I'm not sure how &#34;data quality&#34; could be impacted more than completely unusable.<br /><br />Quicken has a 60-day money back guarantee.  However, months later when they release a patch that causes all of your work to be lost, their is no recourse (other than to write a review warning other potential customers).  I do realize that I can find a backup and can begin the process of recovering all the data since that last backup, but I simply shouldn't have to.  After years of using Quicken and putting up with frustrating issues, I've decided to move on.  They've lost me.  If you are considering Quicken, I would suggest looking for other tools like EveryDollar, Mvelopes, YouNeedABudget, GNUCash, or something else.	2015-05-30

I had been less than pleased with Quicken 2013, but not aggravated enough to quit Intuit altogether. Quicken 2015 has pushed me over the edge to look for a new financial management tool for home finances.

In this upgrade from my 2012 version, Quicken 2015 keyboard shortcuts fail completely with no corrective actions being taken by Intuit.  Ctrl-N, Ctrl-D, switching between registers, standard copy/paste features - none work.  Their support community repeatedly talks about which &#34;context&#34; window is active. To make a keyboard shortcut work, one must take their hands off the keyboard, click at the top bar of the window, then use the shortcut.  That completely goes against the concept of &#34;keyboard shortcut&#34;.  Apparently this issue has been a bug since release, and Intuit isn't paying attention to customer inputs.  Their customer support forum is full of related topics, but no solutions.	2015-05-30

I really was hoping this would be a great solution to the ever increasing need for back-up and file storage.  It most definitely isn't. I easily have 7-8TB I'd like to live elsewhere than my RAID and numerous other misc drives I use to make redundancy especially redundant and this finally looked like a product I'd subscribe to.  I've been a Prime member for 4 or 5 years but never tried the free storage I have, preferring the Dropbox account I've had forever.<br /><br />So, what's so bad? Many little things, but let me just focus on the big 3:<br /><br />#1 is a limit of 20 minutes per movie file.  So forget about backing up your kid's music/theater/dance/sports events here unless you stopped and started while recording and every one of those files is less than the 20 minute limit.  Not really a solution for someone who puts the camera on a tripod, hits record and walks away.<br /><br />#2 - The app appears to be written by a software engineer dropout.  (Harsh?  Yeah, maybe - but I'm really angry at Amazon for getting my hopes up for a reasonably priced Cloud solution with massive amounts of storage) I thought maybe it would be something like Dropbox but it's just a big window that says &#34;drop your files here&#34;.  So you drop your files there but you have no control where they go on your cloud drive.  The web interface is is better - at least it sort of emulates a hard drive file structure interface - but it lacks an intuitive paradigm when it comes to managing file & folder structure (took me awhile to realize you had to put a checkbox next to a folder and then scroll down to the bottom of the page and select &#34;rename&#34; in order to rename that folder.  Yeah, that makes sense....)  But guess what?  If you have large files over 2GB you HAVE to use the app.  If you're using the cloud to back up an external drive (and who wouldn't?) and you want that back-up to have the same file structure as the drive you're backing up (and who wouldn't) you're going to haveto use the app if you have a few large files on there that exceed the 2GB limit unless you want to back up 1 file at a time...<br /><br />#3 - It doesn't work reliably.  Ever.  Maybe I should put this as #1, huh?  You put some files uploading & walk away expecting to find them uploaded when you come back, right?  Doesn't happen.  It shows a progress bar that looks like it's working, but inevitably you come back to a warning message that tells you there were errors, the progress bar isn't moving anywhere and you're left wondering what to do next.  The activity monitor tells me I'm still pushing data at a paltry 1.5MB/s but the app looks like it has stalled out (I have a 120U/25D broadband connection, btw).  And because the app interface doesn't actually show file/folder structure what exactly are your options now? You can't see from that window what has uploaded and what hasn't and even if you could, are you supposed to pour over countless folders and files and try to figure out what doesn't need to be uploaded? If you quit, restart and drag your hard drive contents to the app window again it will just start dumping files to the root level again...<br /><br />Argh.	2015-05-30

I can tell you I was very satisfied with the functionality and features.  I took the leap and decided to buy the new 2015 version and in hindsight, should have paid more attention to the reviews of the 2015 version before I bought it.  I really dislike it to the point I’ve given up trying to use it.  During installation, the data file from my older version transferred successfully, but that is where my satisfaction ended.  The product is not intuitive to use, and good luck with the Help feature.  I encourage you to read all the reviews, but really pay attention to those users of the previous version.	2015-05-30

Many of the features and appearance are the same or very similar as it was for Quicken Essentials so it was very easy to be up and running quickly. With the new Quicken 2015 for Mac, I especially like the ability to download and track investments such as my company 401k. The new button to update all accounts is nice but to update only one account it's a few more key strokes. The new version appears to be better at matching transactions meaning I have transactions that are scheduled and/or memorized and it now matches the downloaded transaction with my scheduled transaction, ending up with only one transaction in my register instead of the old version, I'd end up with two. I was also pleased that I didn't loose old transactions. I've been using Quicken for 15+ years and have accounts that are no longer active but historically have a lot of transactions and they are still there.	2015-05-30
